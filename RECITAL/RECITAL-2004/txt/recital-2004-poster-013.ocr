Résumé — Abstract

Les significations des expressions dans les langues naturelles sont souvent indéterminées
(sous-spécifiées) et nécessitent d’étre enrichies avant de devenir des propositions completes.
La sémantique générale des expressions linguistiques doit étre complétée par les inferences
pragmatiques, identifiées et captées d’une maniere réguliere et permettant ainsi un traitement
opérationnel et méme informatique. Cet article étudie l’indétermination de l’aspect
imperfectif en russe et propose un cadre sémantique et pragmatique pour l’identif1cation de
ses différentes valeurs sémantiques a la base de regles.

Natural language expressions are underspecified and require enrichment to develop into full
ﬂedged propositions. Their sense-general semantics must be complemented with pragmatic
inferences that have to be systematically ﬁgured out and pinned down in a principled way, so
as to make them suitable inputs for NLP algorithms. This paper deals with the underspecified
ipfl aspect in Russian and introduces a semantic and pragmatic framework that might serve
as the basis for a rule-guided derivation of its different readings.

1 Underspeciﬁcation of Russian ipf Aspect

One instance of underspecification is aspect in Russian, especially the ipf, which gives rise to
a considerable variety of readings. These temporal and further, rather specific readings arise
due to an interplay of information provided by different linguistic and non-linguistic sources.
Some examples are illustrated in (la-d) below (cf. Paduéeva 1996). The defeasibility of these

readings indicates their at least partial pragmatic character. A further difficulty for NLP
applications is that — presuming cooperativity — any utterance can receive an interpretation by
appropriately accommodating the context.

(1) a. actual-processual reading
Kogda ja vosel, moj brat cital knigu.
when I enter:PAsT:pf, my brother read:PAsT:ipf a book:ACC.

‘When I entered, my brother was reading a book.’
This reading is assumed to be the default reading, requiring no additional context to arise.
b. general—factual reading

Ty cital etot roman?

you read:PAsT:ipf this novel

‘Have you read this novel?’

This reading poses difficulties for accounts of the ipf in terms of ‘incompletedness’, as the
event in question is completed. Here, English does not allow the progressive aspect which is
marked for (/205,"-selection (section 2) and therefore is incompatible with completedness.

c. potential reading
On choroso igral v sachmaty.
he well play :Past:ipf chess.

‘He could play chess very well.’ = ‘He was a good chess-player’.
This reading arises mainly with a specific group of verbs, combined with manner adverbials.
d. habitual reading

deduska obycno guljal so vnukami, s nimi igral v futbol,
grandpa usually take a walk:PAsT:ipf with grandschildren, with them play:PAsT:ipf football,
kuril trubku, 

smoke:PAsT:ipf pipe,
‘Grandpa used to go for a walk with the grandchildren, he used to play football with
them, he used to smoke a pipe, 

This reading arises with any aspectual form in the presence of adverbials of habituality.

2 Basic semantics

Semantically, a ‘selectional theory’ of aspect is assumed (Bickel 1996), where aspect selects
phases ((p) or boundaries (1). Presuming a tripartite event structure (l\/Ioens/Steedman 1988)
consisting of preparation phase (dynamic phase (/)dy,,), culmination point (boundary 1) and
consequent state (static phase (psm) there are three possibilities for that selection, i.e., for
making the selected part of the event visible and accessible for truth-conditional evaluation at
a validation interval VI. The non-selected parts of the event are presupposed or left to
implicatures. Note, that aspect requires a certain input, and if this input is not given by the
verbal basis, it has to be adjusted accordingly‘. The marked members of the respective
aspectual oppositions explicitly select a certain part; the unmarked forms are sense-general,
their meaning has to be specified semantically or pragmatically. The readings of ipf can be
grouped according to the character of their V], which may be retrospective or synchronous
(bounded or unbounded, cf. Paduceva 1996) with respect to the selected part. The relation

2 Contrary to what an anonymous reviewer pointend out, this analysis does make the correct predictions about
‘He is being silly’ meaning ‘He is acting silly’: the progressive requires a dynamic phase to be present, and
this phase is pragmatically induced resulting in the respective interpretation (M-inference, cf. section 4).

characterizes the values ipf may acquire in interpretation.3 In most cases, V7 is lexically
specified and serves as a hint as to which group of readings (I-III) applies. The respective
reading then is derived by means of context and world-knowledge, cf. ﬁgure I :

VI Relation Reading of the ipf Aspect

H synchronous, non- TT simultaneous with habitual, inactual/continuous, potential,
' bounded (cpdvn 12 (pm) permanent, atemporal
HI. retrospective TT includes (cpdvn 12 (pm) general-factual, durative

3 Basic pragmatics

The pragmatic principles are Levinson’s (2000) default heuristics for interpretation based on
the Gricean Maxims of Conversation (Grice 1989): Q-inferences are based on the first
quantity maxim (‘make your statement as informative as possible’) and license inference to
the negation or invalidity of a stronger expression, M-inferences stem from violations of the
manner maxim (‘avoid prolixity’), and lincense the inference from marked expressions to
marked interpretations. I-inferences are based on the second quantity maxim (‘do not say
more than necessary’) and allow for inference to a stereotype. Contrary to the Gricean view,
however, these are assumed to work also on the subpropositional level giving rise to
‘explicatures’ (Carston 2002), which enrich underspecified lexical representation.

Q-inferences derive the meaning of unmarked forms by giving rise to scalar implicatures
(scale <pf, ipf>), meaning that the use or the weaker element (ipf) entitles the hearer to infer
the non-validity of the stronger expression (pf), thereby giving rise to the three possible
values stated above (ﬁgure I). M-inferences occur here with mismatches between aspectual
selector and verbal basis, i.e. with the application of a (p- or I-selector on a basis that does not
provide the respective feature, which hast to be induced semantically or pragmatically,
thereby enriching the logical structure. This can be systematically captured and formalized by
‘coercion operators’ (Thomas/Pulman 1999; Pulman 1997). I-inferences refer back to world-
knowledge, thereby enriching the lexical meaning of the aspecto-temporal forms. As
frequently encountered concepts are more likely to get activated, they constitute the
stereotypes to which the I-inferences are drawn.

4 Towards a rule-guided derivation

A list of readings has to be established (see ﬁgure 1), the factors involved their derivation
have to be fixed and rules of interaction have to be stated that can be expressed in the
propositional logic form A 9B (cf. Vazov/Lapalme 2000). Interpretation of aspectual forms
processes incrementally, i.e. information once provided and processed can’t be undone. Input
factors for algorithms are the following: Verbs indexed for (p and rthey contain; lexical items

3 That we have indeed to distinguish between those three possibilities is indicated by a look at Turkish, which
has morphological means to express the respective relation (cf. Sonnenhauser 2003).

indexed for whether they add (p or T and aspectual selectors indexed for what they select and
for their status within the language speciﬁc markedness relation. That is how Q-inferences are
drawn. V7 constrains the interpretations of the unmarked aspectual partner. The default
combinations of base and selector have to be stated, as well as rules for resolving the
mismatches. M-inferences then can be pinned down by coercion operators (Pulman 1997;
Thomas/Pulman 1999). More difficult is the problem of how to specify verbs for the
commonsens knowledge they provide access to, which is indespensable for I-inference to be
drawn. One means would be corpus analysis in order to detect regularities and coocurrences
of lexical items that might hint to a conceptual connection. As the factor ‘probability’ can’t be
eliminated, there is to be implemented a condition preferring the shortest line of reasoning
(Thomas/Pulman 1999).

The default case is a ﬁt of basis and marker, where the verbal basis provides the necessary
input for the marker to apply. For ipf, the conditions have to be stated under which the three
possibilites (ﬁgure I) get activated. Here, V7 — primarily temporal or manner adverbials (e. g.
vse bol '§e ‘more and more’, ch0r0§0 ‘well’) — is decisive. Adverbials of cardinality and
duration ﬁx VI as retrospective and the reading as out of group III. The rule for this line of
interpretation can be stated as follows (adopted from Vazov/Lapalme 2000):
(4) IF ipf is applied to a verb providing a phase

AND if there is an adverbial ﬁxing VI as retrospective

THEN the aspectual form gets a reading out of group III.
(5) durative reading

Ja guljala ot trech to pjati.

I go-for-a-walk:PAsT:ipf from three:Gen to ﬁve:Gen

‘From three to ﬁve, I went for a walk.’
This interpretation can be overridden if V7 is turned into a synchronous one by adverbials of
the type vsegda (‘always’) or 0byc'n0 (‘usually’).
(6) a. habitual reading

J a obycno gulj ala ot trech to pjati.
I usually go-for-walk:PAsT:ipf from three:GEN to ﬁve:GEN
‘I usually went for a walk from three to ﬁve.’

This shows the incremental way of interpretation, whereby the inner parts are left intact:
b. [syn_m,bo.mded obycno [rem ot. ..do [synjggunded gulj al]]]

A synchronous V7 may be bounded or unbounded (group I and II, table 1), cf. (7) and (8):

(7) IF ipf is applied to a verb providing a phase
AND if there is an adverbial ﬁxing VI as synchronous bounded/unbounded
THEN the aspectual form gets a reading out of group I/II

(8) a. actual-processual reading
V vosem' casov, ja citala knigu.
at eight o'clock, I read:Past:ipf book:Acc

‘At eight o'clock, I was reading a book.’

b. inactual reading

Ran'§e, on rabotal v universitete.
before he work:PAsT:ipf at university
‘He used to work at university.’ (= ‘He was working as a teacher.’)

Depending on the semantic representation of the verb, implicatures or presuppositions may
arise. Ipf with the structure [(p 1] leaves the reaching of the boundary as an implicature, ipf
with [1 (p] leaves the initial boundary as presupposition.

Towards a rule—guided derivation of aspectual readings in Russian

Whenever an aspectual marker is applied on a basis not providing the relevant feature ((p or 1)
for it to apply, that feature is semantically or pragmatically induced in order to eliminate that
mismatch. Coercion operators capture this recategorization process (Pulman 1997):
(9) a. Ivan vyigral gonku.

Ivan win:PAsT:pf race:ACC

‘Ivan won the race. ’
Here, pf is applied to a verb that provides a 2', no coercion is necessary.

b. Ivan vyigryval gonku (cetyre raza).
Ivan win: PAsT:ipf race:ACC (four times).
‘Ivan won the race four times / was winning the race.’
The application of ipf in (9b) requires a (p, which the verb vyigrat' (‘win’) does not provide.
So it has to be induced by iteration or by zooming in on (/205,". Two coercion operators may be
applied: “iterate / stretch: point —> process” (Pulman 1997). In most cases, context provides
the necessary cues for disambiguation, if not, one has to rely on the ‘probability-condition’.
C. V vosem casov ona uie vysla.
at eight o'clock she already leave:PAsT:pf
‘At eight o'clock, she had already left.’ (= she was gone)
For the consequent-state reading in (9c), the preﬁx vy- induces the boundary required for pf to
apply. The reading arises due to the particle uz'e (‘already’); the coercion operator is “add-
cstate: X —> <X, state>, where X is point or process” (Pulman 1997). The rules for (9b) are:
(10) a. IF ipf is applied to a verb providing no phase,
AND a lexical item indicating iteration is present
THEN induce the phase by application of ‘iterate’
b. IF ipf is applied to a verb providing no phase
AND and adverbial/clause indicating incidence is present
THEN induce the phase by application of ‘stretch’
The application of ipf onto a verbal basis providing merely a 1 (prior to coercion) is both
pragmatically and morphologically marked, but ipf does not lose its semantic unmarkedness.
Though interpretation in terms of coercion is compositional, the specific reading this coercion
gives rise to dependens on linguistic context and world-knowledge (de Swart 1998); cf. (11)4:

(1 1) On resal zadacu.
he solve:PAsT:ipf exercise:ACC
a. actual-processual reading
‘He was solving the exercise.’
b. conative reading
‘He tried to solve the exercise.’
c. general—factual reading

‘He solved the exercise.’

Whereas (c) can be disambiguated by fixing V7 as retrospective, (a) and (b) cannot be
distinguished by VI alone as both require it to be synchronous. The distinction between the
possible readings is left to contextual disambiguation and world-knowledge. Gaining
probability values and for interpretations by a statistical approach taking into account
judgements of native speakers helps (Glovinskaja 1982), but the probability rankings can be
overriden by the lexical content of verb al phrases.

4 The readings listed here involve different degrees of context-dependency.

5 Concluding remarks

The framework presented here allows for taking also pragmatic reasoning processes into
account in computing interpretations. Without a principled account of inferential principles
NLP applications have to fail. This rather sketchy picture presented here is to serve as a
starting point for identifying semantic and pragmatic factors in the aspecto-temporal system
of Russian. A lot of problems remain to be solved. Corpus analyses and the appropriate
annotation of verbs, aspect markers and adverbials are the prerequisite for formulating rules
that enable the systematic derivation and computation of the readings. Furthermore, the
interaction of the different factors has to be studied in a wider domain, i.e. on the paragraph
level.
