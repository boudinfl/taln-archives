It can be used in an exploratory or confirmatory way. Here the aim is exploratory. The clustering algorithm chosen for the experiment is K-means, as implemented in SPSS. K-means is suitable for large datasets, it is easy to understand and very fast. However, it involves two hard decisions, one concerning the number of clusters that better represent the data, the other related to the set of initial seeds. Several alternatives are available (cf. Anderberg 1973). In this experiment, random seeds were used (default in SPSS), and the number of clusters was selected on the basis of the maximum distance between clusters and the minimum distance within each cluster. This approach ensures the highest distinctiveness and compactness of a solution. A 15-cluster solution was suggested for both sets of features. The following steps were performed: • Extraction of 1000 random English web pages from the SPIRIT collection. • Parsing of the text-only version of the web pages. • Extraction and frequency counts of the two sets of features. • Normalization of the fre</context>

The type of these web pages is easily recognizable. These pages comprises very short server messages, lists of names and extensions, a glossary, bibliographies, tables, summary lists; etc. We asked a web user to manually cluster the 24 web pages in the minority clusters and assign six labels (server message, telephone directory, bibliographic references, glossary, tabular information, summary list) to the pages. Then we compared the user’s clustering with the automatic clustering and computed the K statistic as an inter-rater measure (Carletta 1996). The value returned was above 0.90, indicating a very good level of agreement. The almost complete agreement of the two cluster solutions with human assessment on the minority clusters is an important confirmation of the validity of the approach. As for the majority clusters (see poster), web pages in “con_sub cluster 6” (368 cases) fall almost entirely (more than 98%) into “sy_pat cluster 1”. This is a sign of stability. This cluster includes web pages with highly laid-out information, little text, centered (hot)lists, a photograph with personal details, such as address, phone, email, etc. T</context>

Emerging textual patterns can develop into novel Web genres or novel text types in the near future. The experimental set up includes a collection of unclassified web pages, two sets of features and the use of cluster analysis. Results are encouraging and deserve further investigation. Marina Santini 1 The Web: An Evolution still in progress The Web has had a strong impact on the genre repertoire. Novel genres have already emerged (Crowston and Williams 1997) such as personal home pages, hotlists, FAQs, and more recently blogs, ezines, clogs, etc. Presumably, other new genres are still in formation, because the Web is still fluid and in constant change. Three main well-established genre categories have been identified on the Web: reproduced/replicated, adapted/variant, novel/spontaneous (Crowston and Williams 1997; Shepherd and Watters 1998). Many genres on the Web are reproduced or replicated genres, i.e. they are traditional paper genres that have been transplanted into an electronic form, such as academic papers.

From this preliminary study, it appears that although automatic clustering did not return any emerging genres, traditional rhetorical/discoursal types could be identified, despite some noise. The presence of this noise was ascribed to the use of shallow features, too shallow to highlight textual novelties. Some references to “unclassified” web pages can be derived indirectly from the few surveys carried out so far on web pages. Crowston and Williams (1997) found that some of the web pages could not be classified because they did not have a recognizable genre. In these cases, the raters agreed that there was a genre, but did not know its name, and labelled the pages as “unclassified”. Interestingly, one of the conclusions was that some of these unclassified pages could be interpreted as belonging to “emerging genres”. Similarly, in Roussinov et al. (2001)&apos;s exploratory user study on Web genres, a number of pages could not be classified, but no special conclusions were drawn.

Many genres on the Web are reproduced or replicated genres, i.e. they are traditional paper genres that have been transplanted into an electronic form, such as academic papers. However, most genres coming from the paper world have undergone some adjustments when moving on to the Web and variants have been created. For instance, online newspapers and online manuals show the adaptation of paper genres to the functionalities provided by the Web (cf. Crowston and Williams 1999, Shepherd and Watters 1999). Some genres are novel and spontaneous. They have become fully acknowledged and genre labels have been invented for them only in recent years, for instance home pages (personal, academic, organizational, etc.), FAQs, newsletters, emails, weblogs. However, there are many web pages that do not fall into one of these three categories. It is often hard to assign a genre label to a web page.

In this paper we present an experiment that explores the possibility of automatically detecting emerging textual patterns that are slowly taking shape on the Web.

The first set of features includes 28 functional cues, 29 syntactic patterns, and 33 HTML tags (90 features). We will refer to this set as sy_pat. The second set includes instead 28 functional cues, 52 connectives and subordinators, and 33 HTML tags (113 features). We will refer to this set as con_sub. Functional cues and syntactic patterns are hand-crafted and parser-dependent features (the Marina Santini parser used in this experiment is Connexor by Tapanainen and Järvinen (1997); Santini (2005b) contains the description and motivation of these features). Connectives and subordinators are lexical items. They represent an easy way to capture syntactic and discoursal information, even though their semantic interpretation is often ambiguous. Finally, HTML tags account for layout and functionalities, both important elements in a web page. Two sets of features represent two views on the same data. As cluster analysis has a somewhat subjective nature, cluster solutions must be validated. Here we use the extent of the overlap between the two cluster solutions returned by the two sets of fe</context>

The largest cluster, instead, shows a kind of mixed textuality and appears to be still too heterogeneous. The cluster is too big to have one single profile. Many of its web pages look like “containers” showing different communicative purposes. 4 Conclusions Results are encouraging and the approach seems to be effective in providing hints about emerging textual patterns. With unsupervised techniques, deep linguistic features appear to be much more effective than shallow features (cf. Santini 2005a). Although vagueness and elusiveness are common conditions before a novel textual pattern becomes formally and functionally established and recognized, a couple of emerging textual patterns could be identified. In our opinion, they have a good chance of becoming novel web genres or text types once their traits become more tightly woven. Although the objective evaluation of emergent textual patterns is a new and open issue (any discussions on this subject will be fruitful), as a whole the approach proposed to identify Marina Santini emerging textual patterns seems to be valid.

Marina Santini 1 The Web: An Evolution still in progress The Web has had a strong impact on the genre repertoire. Novel genres have already emerged (Crowston and Williams 1997) such as personal home pages, hotlists, FAQs, and more recently blogs, ezines, clogs, etc. Presumably, other new genres are still in formation, because the Web is still fluid and in constant change. Three main well-established genre categories have been identified on the Web: reproduced/replicated, adapted/variant, novel/spontaneous (Crowston and Williams 1997; Shepherd and Watters 1998). Many genres on the Web are reproduced or replicated genres, i.e. they are traditional paper genres that have been transplanted into an electronic form, such as academic papers. However, most genres coming from the paper world have undergone some adjustments when moving on to the Web and variants have been created. For instance, online newspapers and online manuals show the adaptation of paper genres to the functionalities provided by the Web (cf. Crowston and Williams 1999, Shepherd and Watters 1999). Some genres are novel and spontaneous. They have become fully acknowledged and genre labels</context>

They have become fully acknowledged and genre labels have been invented for them only in recent years, for instance home pages (personal, academic, organizational, etc.), FAQs, newsletters, emails, weblogs. However, there are many web pages that do not fall into one of these three categories. It is often hard to assign a genre label to a web page. Many web pages remain “unclassified” or labelled as “mixed” (Santini 2005a). We suggest that those web pages that are unclassifiable might represent an emerging textual pattern, i.e. a new textual organization</context>

The first set of features includes 28 functional cues, 29 syntactic patterns, and 33 HTML tags (90 features). We will refer to this set as sy_pat. The second set includes instead 28 functional cues, 52 connectives and subordinators, and 33 HTML tags (113 features). We will refer to this set as con_sub. Functional cues and syntactic patterns are hand-crafted and parser-dependent features (the Marina Santini parser used in this experiment is Connexor by Tapanainen and Järvinen (1997); Santini (2005b) contains the description and motivation of these features). Connectives and subordinators are lexical items. They represent an easy way to capture syntactic and discoursal information, even though their semantic interpretation is often ambiguous. Finally, HTML tags account for layout and functionalities, both important elements in a web page. Two sets of features represent two views on the same data. As cluster analysis has a somewhat subjective nature, cluster solutions must be validated. Here we use the extent of the overlap between the two cluster solutions returned by the</context>
