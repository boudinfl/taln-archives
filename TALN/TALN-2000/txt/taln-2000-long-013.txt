Abstract
A systematic and principled account of verb subcategorization is important for large-
scale lexicon construction. A given verb may have several subcategorization frames in
which its arguments appear. Starting from a lexical-semantic description of event struc-
ture, we describe a mechanism for generating subcategorization properties for a large vari-
ety of verb classes. In this paper, we motivate this mechanism by proposing a distinction
between two kinds of resultative as well as the unaccusative and middle constructions.
1.       Background
We represent verb meanings in terms of event templates (Pustejovsky, 1995), in par-
ticular those inspired by (Rappaport Hovav & Levin, 1998), also (1991; 1995; 1999). An
event template consists of a constant, the verb-specific core meaning that supplies spell-
out, and an event structure, common to all verbs of a class, containing a small number of
primitive elements that combine in a finite number of ways. The basic semantic templates
(STs) are as follows:
Activity    [ x ACT<manner> ]    Achievement    [ BECOME [ x <state> ]]
State       [ x <state> ]        Accomplishment [ x CAUSE [ BECOME [ y <state> ]]]
Canonical realization rules pair constants (verbs) with STs:
manner                  → [ ACT<manner> ]                             jog, run, creak, whistle
internally caused state → [ x <state> ]       bloom, blossom, decay, flower, rot, rust, sprout
externally caused state → [[ x ACT ] CAUSE [ BECOME [ y <state> ]]] break, dry, harden, melt
STs may be simple or complex, i.e. augmented by the addition of subevent templates.
The following examples are taken from (Rappaport Hovav & Levin, 1998):
Phil swept (the floor)     [ x ACT<sweep>y ]
Phil swept the floor clean [[ x ACT<sweep>y ] CAUSE [ BECOME [ y <state> ]]]
Furthermore, template augmentation is constrained by rules prohibiting the elimination
of elements and non-compositionality. For example:
Princeton University and NEC Research Institute

*Achievement → Activity                               (<state> can’t be eliminated)
*Activity → Achievement             (*[ BECOME [ x ACT<manner> ]] non-compositional)
In the following sections, we propose a new semantic template theory for dealing with
resultatives expressing change of state and transformation into new entities. In contrast
to (Rappaport Hovav & Levin, 1998), who adopt a single template theory that grows
monotonically as sub-events are added, we introduce the notion of a primary template
expressing the core meaning of the verb in conjunction with a secondary template ex-
pressing secondary predication. A secondary template will be constrained in two ways:
(1) via a general requirement that its elements must be checked-off, or licensed, against
corresponding elements in the primary template, and (2) semantic admissibility condi-
tions (to be described below). We also show how these admissibility conditions operate
on primary templates in the case of both middle and achievement formation.
2.     Two Types of Resultatives
We draw a semantic distinction between Adjective Phrase (AP) and Prepositional
Phrase (PP) resultatives. Both refer to a state brought about by the event denoted by
the verb. The following examples illustrate how different verb types select for resultatives:

(1)    (a)   I danced/ran *tired/*into an athlete                      (neither AP nor PP)
(b)   I broke/bent the bracelet into pieces/a U/*ruined                    (PP only)
(c)   I wiped/swept/rubbed the floor clean/*into a shiny surface           (AP only)
(d)   I cleaned the floor *sparkling/*into a shiny surface      (neither AP nor PP)
(e)   I wrote/conceptualized the book *interesting/*into a bestseller       (same as
above)
(f)   John pounded/crushed/hammered the metal flat/into a thin sheet (AP and
PP)
3.     Resultatives and Semantic Templates
Our analysis rests crucially on the distinction between change of state and transfor-
mation into a new entity for AP and PP resultatives, respectively.

A. An AP resultative, expressing the result of a change of state, comes with its own
distinct template:

(2)   y be <state>

B. Elements in a secondary template must be identified or checked off against elements
in the main template. For example, the y in “y be <state>” must be identified with
a corresponding y in the main template:

(3)   (a)   John wiped the table clean
(b)   John wiped the table & the table clean
(c)   x act<manner> on y & y be <state>

(d)   John act<wip(ing)> on the table & the table be clean

If y is not present in the main template, the derivation fails:

(4)   (a) ∗ John jogged dizzy
(b) x act<manner> & y be <dizzy>                                 (y unchecked)

C. A PP resultative expresses a transformation; it comes with its own distinct template:

(5)   y become y

y represents the new entity that y has transformed into as a result of an event:

(6)   (a)   He spun wool into gold
(b)   He spun wool & wool into gold
(c)   x caus y xform<manner> (y ) & y becomes y

In (6c), y in the secondary template checks off against implicit y (shown in paren-
theses) in the primary template.
4.     Conditions on Resultatives
Both the AP and PP resultatives select for a primary ST with the following conditions:

D.     (i) y must be present                                              (cf. (B) above)
This condition merely states the requirement for a direct object, on which the
resultant state or transformation is predicated.
(ii) ∗ . . .<state>. . .
Statehood, including (non-)existence, expressed as a constant cannot appear
in the primary ST.
(iii) “y will be y”                                          (no transformation of y)
This condition holds only for AP resultatives, where y does not get transformed
into a new entity as a result of the event.
5.     Consequences
Let us re-examine the data from section 2 given these conditions.
First, unergative verbs, such as dance, jog, laugh, run and sleep, are intransitives whose
subject is an underlying external argument (semantically, an AGENT or ACTOR), (Perl-
mutter, 1978). These verbs cannot select for a resultative:

(7)    (a)   John jogs/dances/sleeps
(b) ∗ John jogs/dances/sleeps tired               (resultative, not depictive reading)

(8)    (a)   x act<manner>

(b)    x act<manner> & y be <state>                                               (violates Di)

(7a) and (7b) have STs (8a) and (8b), respectively. (8b) violates condition (Di) since y
in the secondary template remains unchecked against a y in the primary template.
Unergatives can have an AP resultative if a fake reflexive is introduced (Simpson, 1983).
Contrast (9a) with (9b):

(9)     (a) ∗ I danced/ran tired
(b)    I danced/ran myself tired/*into an athlete

The fake reflexive introduces a y into the primary template for these otherwise intransitive
verbs, and thus secondary y can be correctly checked off.
Next, many activity verbs, e.g. mop, paint, shoot, sweep or wipe, take either an optional
or an obligatory direct object. As (10) shows, only AP resultatives are possible:

(10) (a)       John wiped/mopped/swept the floor clean
(b) ∗ John wiped/mopped/swept the floor into a shiny surface

These verbs have has ST (11a):

(11) (a)       x act<manner> on y
(b)    x act<manner> on y & y be <state>
(c)    x act<manner> on y & y become y                                             (violates B)

Here (10b) is ruled out since y (the new entity) remains unchecked in (11c).
Third, verbs like break, and tear express a resulting change of state in the direct object.
These verbs are compatible with PP resultatives only:

(12) (a)       John broke/tore the painting
(b)    John broke/tore the painting into pieces
(c) ∗ John broke/tore the painting ruined/worthless
(13) (a)       x caus y xform<manner> (y )
(b)    x caus y xform<manner> (y ) & y become y
(c)    x caus y xform<manner> (y ) & y be <state>                                (violates Diii)

In the transform template, y is the (implicit) new entity that y transforms into. y need
not be expressed in syntax.1
(12c) is ruled out because an AP resultative indicates the state of y after the event,
but verbs like break and tear imply a transformation of y into a new entity y’, i.e. y is
changed as a result of the event. Rule (Diii) encodes this intuition.
Fourth, verbs that are derived from adjectives, either by zero-affix morphology e.g. clean,
or by an affix, resist resultatives of any kind:
1
It will be expressed when it is checked off by a secondary template as in (12b).

(14) (a)        I cleaned the floor
(b) ∗ I cleaned the floor sparkling/into a shiny surface
(15) (a)        x caus y become <state>
(b)   x caus y become <state> & y be <state> (violates Dii: <state> in primary
ST)
(c)   x caus y become <state> & y become y                             (violates Di and Dii)

Finally, verbs expressing the creation or destruction of an entity such as write, paint
and eat are incompatible with a resultative:

(16) (a)        I wrote the book
(b) ∗ I wrote the book interesting/into a bestseller2
(17) (a)        x caus y become<manner> exist(+)
(b)   x caus y become<manner> exist(+) & y be <state>                            (violates Dii)
(c)   x caus y become<manner> exist(+) & y become y                              (violates Dii)

The end state for the entity expressed by the direct object of a creation/destruction verb
will be exist(±). End states preclude AP and PP resultatives (Dii).
In summary, we saw that unergatives and activities take only AP resultatives, verbs
of transformation or change take only a PP resultative, and verbs encoding a final state
and verbs of creation/destruction take neither resultative.
6.        Achievements
According to (Rappaport Hovav & Levin, 1998), achievements are events referring to
changes of state, as shown in 6 (adopting our terminology):

(18) y become <state>

We propose the following conditions for deriving achievement templates from a given
primary template:

F.        (i) y must be present
(ii) x[-sentient]

(Fii) states that the causing entity must be non-sentient, i.e. inanimate. Here are some
examples of non-sentient causers:
wind, rain, storm, cold    anger, greed                            acid, drugs, mold
(natural force)            (emotion, psychological motive)         (substances)
We adopt the following notation:
2
Contrast (16b) with: I rewrote the book *interesting/into a bestseller. Rewrite is not a creation verb.
re- affixation turns some creation verbs into verbs of transformation.

G.    (i) x               underspecified, i.e. x[sentient] ∨ x[-sentient]
(ii) x[sentient]     (agent)
(iii) x[-sentient]   (causer)

(Fi) requires an object, namely y. It excludes all unergatives like run, which have tem-
plates with x only.
Verbs of transformation like break, melt and tear have ST (13). The lexicon specifies
the nature of x with respect to sentience. Melt and break have an underspecified x (Gi)
and thus allow both sentient and non-sentient causers:

(19) (a)     The sun/John melted/broke the ice
(b)   The ice melted/broke

Spin can only have an agent (sentient) causer, see (20a), and has ST (20b); this precludes
achievement formation:

(20) (a)     The magician/*momentum spun the wool
(b)   x[sentient] caus y xform<manner> (y )
(c) ∗ Wool spun                                                        (violates Fii)

Activity verbs such as wipe in (21a) tend to have sentient causers only: hence ST (21b):

(21) (a)     *The wind/John wiped the table
(b)   x[sentient] act<manner> on y
(c) ∗ The table wiped

(21c) is out for same reason as (20c); the requirement for a sentient causer in the verb’s
lexical specification precludes achievement formation.
Third, de-adjectival verbs like clean have sentient causers; others like empty may admit
±sentient causers:

(22) (a)     I/*the mop cleaned the floor
(b) ∗ The floor cleaned

(23) (a)     The sale/customers emptied the store
(b)   The store emptied

Clean and empty have STs (24a) and (24b), respectively:

(24) (a)     x[sentient] caus y become <state>             (blocks Achievement formation)
(b)   x caus y become <state>

7.   Intrinsic Achievements
Some verbs denote events that are always internally caused; consequently, these verbs
do not have a transitive/causative alternation. For example, (25a) could have the ST (25b):

(25) (a)   The flowers blossomed/bloomed
(b)   y become <state>

With a resultative, the composite ST (26) would be inadmissible (violating (Dii); the
constraint that AP resultatives are incompatible with <state> in the primary template):

(26) y become <state> & y be <state>                                         (violates Dii)

Apparent counterexamples are (27):

(27) The flowers blossomed/bloomed red

But note that blossom and bloom have an additional, stative reading (28b) with a cor-
responding template template (28a). The stativity is shown by the presence of the for
phrase (Vendler, 1967):

(28) (a)   y be <state>
(b)   The flowers blossomed/bloomed (for days)

The adjuncts in (29) show that (27) is a stative and thus incompatible with a resultative,
rather, red in (27) is a depictive.

(29) The flowers blossomed/bloomed red for days/*in a day

Achievements and Resultatives
We saw earlier that some verbs like melt in (19a) form achievements. Unaccusative melt
as in (30a) may take a PP resultative (30c), but not an AP resultative (30b):

(30) (a)   The ice melted
(b) ∗ The ice melted liquid
(c)   The ice melted into a liquid

Melt has ST (31a). Therefore, (30b) and (30c) have STs (31b) and (31c), respectively.

(31) (a)   x caus y xform<manner> (y )
(b)   y xform<melt> (y ) & y be <state>
(c)   y xform<melt> (y ) & y become y

(31b) (but not (31c)) violates the “y will be y” condition, namely (Diii).
Finally, some verbs, such as decompose, decay, deteriorate, rot and wither, denote events
that cannot be caused by a sentient AGENT but only by a natural cause or phenomenon:
(32) (a)   Humidity/*John deteriorated/rotted the body
(b)   x[-sentient] caus y xform<manner> (y )
(c)   The body deteriorated/rotted
(d) ∗ The body deteriorated/rotted dry                                  (violates Diii)
(e)   The body deteriorated/rotted into slime
The ST for (32a) is (32b). Here, x[-sentient] permits (32c) to be formed. (32b) also blocks
the AP resultative (32d) but allows the PP. Compare this with the ST for melt in (31a),
where the cause is unspecified with respect to sentience.
To summarize, some verbs take only sentient causers, some only non-sentient, and
others both. This distinction is used to facilitate or block Achievement formation, and is
also relevant for another alternation: the Middle construction.
8.   The Middle
The middle construction is characterized by the following central properties: (A) a
transitive verb, (B) whose Patient or Affected Argument (normally appearing in direct
object position) is the subject, (C) has a “generic” interpretation, not specific to (a)
particular agent(s), and (D) paraphrases with tough-movement or -able affixation on
the verb. See (Fellbaum, 1985) for more detail, also (Fellbaum & Zribi-Hertz, 1989))
and (Keyser & Roeper, 1984)).
(33) (a)   These drawers open/install easily     (It is easy to open/install these drawers)
(b)   John opened/installed these drawers
The middle often seems indistinguishable from the unaccusative, but a careful analysis
reveals differences between these constructions that affect their distribution:
(34) (a)   Spy novels read easily                                                  (middle)
(b)   It is easy (for someone) to read spy novels
(c)   John reads spy novels
(d) ∗ Spy novels read                                                   (unaccusative)

(35) (a)   These flowers wilted last night                                   (unaccusative)
(b) ∗ It is easy (for someone) to wilt these flowers
(c) ∗ John wilted these flowers

To undergo middle formation, a verb must select for an agent (a necessary but not suffi-
cient condition). A wilting event cannot be directly caused by an Agent, hence (35a) is
not a middle and both (35c) and the paraphrase (35b) are ungrammatical.
In general:

• All middles will have accomplishment-style counterparts, e.g. (33b) for (33a).
• Not all middles will have achievement counterparts, e.g. (34d) for (34a).
• Middle verbs undergo -able affixation: driveable, steerable, openable. Contrast with
*wiltable and *deterioratable.
9.     Conditions on Middle Formation
To allow middle formation, verb templates must satisfy the following conditions:

H.     (i) y must be present
(ii) x[sentient]                                                   agent (sentient)
(iii) *exist(±)                                        *creation/destruction verbs

Let us examine how these conditions apply to the verb classes and STs we have discussed.
We saw earlier that melt and break have ST (13) with a causer unspecified with respect
to sentience. Hence, both (36a) and (36b) can be formed:

(36) (a)      Ice melts/breaks easily                                              (middle)
(b)    Ice melts/breaks                                              (unaccusative)

Contrast this with saw, which has a sentient causer in its ST (37c). Hence, achievement
but not middle formation is blocked:

(37) (a)      I/*corrosion sawed the pipes
(b) ∗ The pipe sawed                  (violates Fii: achievement formation blocked)
(c)    x[sentient] y xform (y )
(d)    Plastic pipes saws easily

Thus, not all middles (37d) have achievement counterparts (37b). Although all middles
have transitive counterparts, the reverse does not hold:

(38) (a)      Nero built/destroyed/ruined the temple
(b) ∗ Temples build/destroy/ruin easily
(c)    x caus y become<manner> exist(±)

Verbs of creation/destruction are generally incompatible with middles (Fellbaum, 1985).
Build, destroy and ruin have the ST (38c), which violates (Hiii).
