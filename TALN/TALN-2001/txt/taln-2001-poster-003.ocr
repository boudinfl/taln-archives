Résumé — Abstract

Les résumés constitués de phrases extraites d'un texte contiennent souvent des mots inutiles;
il est possible de les éliminer ou d'en réduire le nombre. Par un étude comparative des phrases
du documents et des phrases correspondantes dans le résumé, cet article présente un
inventaire partiel des unités qui sont souvent éliminées ou réduites en nombre. Les
metadiscours, les textes entre parentheses, les unités redondantes (emphases, répétitions), les
appositions, modifieurs et relatives ne sont pas 51 place dans un résumé.

Abstracts constituted from extracted sentences contain unneeded information that may be
deleted, or compressed into simpler units. By comparing full text sentences used in
abstracting with correspond-ing sentences in abstract, the study found such units to include
metadiscourse phrases, parenthetical texts, redundant units inserted for emphasis, or are
repetitions. Apposed texts and units such as modifiers and relative clauses which provide
details and precision in the full text, but are out of place in an abstract, are also deleted.

1 Introduction

Abstracts constituted from extracted sentences (Kupiec et al., 1995; Marcu, 1997; Barzilay &
Elhadad, 1997) are not only disjointed, but also contain unneeded texts that may be deleted or
compressed. To improve on cohesion and coherence of an extracted abstract, Jing (2000:311-
312) removes as many “extraneous phrases” as possible based on “context weight” calculated
for each word. While Jing’s results are optimistic, what would be desirable is if superﬂuous
linguistic units can be semi-automatically pruned off using a checklist, and reduction effected
on compressible units. So, just what are some of these units that may be deleted, or
compressed?

While Saggion (2000:58-59) did identify four types of deletion, our study will seek to
extend on this operation, and identify the function of the units involved. We will also discuss
compression during which inessential lexical units are removed from a linguistic unit. The
basic meaning is however left unaltered in the indispensable units. The types of unit and

context under which linguistic units may be condensed are important considerations for
abstracting systems. However, our study is preliminary and a proper investigation is needed.

2 Method

Fifty-seven articles from two on-line journals on biology were used for the study. All
sentences in full text (ft-) and abstract (ab-) were given a code indicating its location in the
document. For example, a sentence with location code [R-2-1] is the first sentence in the
second paragraph of the Results section (I = Introduction; M = Method; D = discussion; A =
abstract). On the basis of verbatim matches, similarity in stem and meaning, a manual search
was made for ft-sentences that were probable sources of information in abstracting. Examples
are presented in the following format: <ft-sentence> —> <ab-sentence>; REL(ft-LU) = ab-LU.
The lexico-semantic relation (REL) between a deleted and undeleted word is looked up in
WordNet (VVN), and given in the notation of the Explanatory-Combinatorial Dictionary
(Melcuk et al., 1995; Melcuk, 1996).

3 Results and Discussion

3.1 Deletion

3. 1. 1 Metadiscourse

Metadiscourse is “Writing about writing, whatever does not refer to the subject matter being
addressed” (VVilliams, 1981 cited by Vande Kopple, 1985). Vande Kopple (ibid.:83) explains
that an author usually writes at two levels. At one level, propositional content on a subject is
supplied, and at another, metadiscourse which does not contribute to the content, but helps a
reader “interpret  [the] material” is added. The implication here is that if superﬂuous
metadiscourse can be reliably deleted, then what is left is the propositional content.

Illocution markers which “make explicit [the] speech or discourse act [performed] at
certain points” (ibid.:83-85), and connectives are two types of metadiscourse commonly
deleted during abstracting ((1) = omission). Closely associated with illocution markers are first
person pronouns. Forty percent (22/552) of documents exclude an author’s overt presence
from the abstract, by using the agentless passive and personifying inanimate nouns (see (2))
which is typical of scientific writing. The group of verbs involved include study and observe.
As much as metadiscourse does not contribute to propositional content, not all types of
metadiscourse are deleted to the same degree during abstracting. Unlike illocution markers,
connectives in the source sentences are almost always deleted. The information selected for
inclusion in an abstract is then reformulated and re-connected with “new” connectives.

Because connectives are identifiable, and we and I are the two main overt indicators of
author, both metadiscourse types may be deleted from extracted sentences without any need

for computation of salience, which is a desirable feature for automatic summarizers.
However, a study into the degree to which illocution markers may be deleted is necessary.
According to Meyers (1992:297), metadiscourse phrases such as We found that, are
stereotypical means of making “strong, distinctive, but polite claims”.

3.1.2 Precision and Details

Ouantifier, determiner, apposed text

The restricted length of an abstract has little place for precision and details. During
abstracting, determiners, quantifiers, including nouns of measure, e.g. density, and numeric
expressions which provide details may be omitted. Deletion is however not consistent. In (3),
measure noun density was deleted, but not in (11). Linguistic units most reliably deleted are
parenthetical and apposed texts (see (4)). A deleted meaning may be re-expressed elsewhere
(see subscripted units in (3)).

NOUN1-of-NOUN2 (N 1 -of-N2) construction

In NOUN1-of-NOUN2 constructions, a deleted unit can be the lexical noun before or after of In
(5), while the first noun is dispensable, deletion of the second noun leads to
ungrammaticality: *inﬂuenced only one aspect 4). In (6), where either may be omitted, the
more detailed is deleted, it suffices as is often the case, to keep the noun that expresses the

(5) inﬂuenced en-l=y—eneaspeet—e£ male activity or microhabitat use; [R-3-5]
A inﬂuenced 4) water strider behavior; [A-1-9; oec2-971 1725 8]

coexisting juvenile instars. [I-6-2]
A Preliminary ﬁeld observations 4) indicated an extended reproductive period, which results
in a very wide size distribution of juvenile instars. [A-1-3; besl-9945349]

While deletion is not linked to position, neither does it appear to be word-dependent
except for species where it is deleted in two clear situations for the corpus studied: (a) if the
meaning of phrase species of X, is the same as X itself (see (7)), and (b) if it is clear that the
noun in question is a species name, i.e. R. alternata (see (8)).

Prepositional modifiers and adverbials which provide details are often deleted, but
may also be appended to add disparate information about the experiment.

3. 1.3 Implicit knowledge

A modifier containing information that is discoverable from the head noun or context, may be
deleted. While the social nature of spider mites in (9) may be found from domain, in (10), the
semantic component of immature in young is implicit in larvae.

(9) In a subseeia-l spider mite, Schizotetranychus miscanthi Saito,  [I-2-l]
A the (1) spider mite, Schizotetranychus miscanthi ... [A-l-l; besl-9946025]

(10) The presence of young larvae also affects the proportion of foragers collecting pollen: ..[I-2-5]
A The decision to collect pollen by honey bee foragers depends on the number of <1) larvae
(brood),  [A-1-2; bes2-9844193]
Syn(young) = immature (WN) {Syn = synonym}; larva = immature free-living form (WN)

In scientific reportage, it is implicit that observations must be signiﬁcant to be
reported, and that assessments when made are relative to some referent. Modifiers signiﬁcant
and relative were retained (2-3 times) more often than they are deleted. While implicit, the
modifiers lend credence to the results. As much as findings on the deletion of evaluative
modifiers are not conclusive, subjective evaluative modifiers such as readily and dramatic,
are almost always deleted.

3. 1. 4 Explicitness

Hypemym

A common noun, scientific name, or a technical name may be made more explicit by
postposing it with its hypernym which contains redundant information. A hypernym was not
found to be deleted, when it postposes a technical name, e.g. chrysomelid in (4). However,
when it postposes a scientific name (see (11)), it is deleted 44% (8/18) of the time. While it is
clear to novice readers that scientific names, which are always in italics or underscored, are
proper names, it is not clear what technical names may refer to, and this hampers
comprehension.

(l 1) there was a  decline in the density of the mature S. punicea pl-a-Hts  [R-2-2]
A There has been a  decline in the density of mature S. punicea <1) 
[A-l-6; oecl-98114343]
Hypernym(S. punicea) = plant (domain knowledge); Hypernym(plant) = life form (WN)
Hypemyms postposed to lexically ambiguous common nouns are not deleted, except
in the case of partial repetitions. Where absent, an appropriate one may even be inserted. A
common domain-related hypernym for an ACTIVITY noun is behavior.

While WordNet appears to be an adequate resource for finding relations between
words, even those involving knowledge in biology, a problem that confronts abstracting by
sentence extraction is in deciding which among the possible hypernyms to use in a semi-
automatic abstracting environment. As some words may have their own domain-related
hypernym, a special thesaurus supplemented with domain knowledge will be invaluable.

Contrary to technical nouns which usually have but one restricted meaning, common
nouns may be polysemic or lexically ambiguous. To make explicit its meaning, the hypernym
cooccurring with a common noun is retained, and where absent, an appropriate one may even
be inserted. The non-deletion and insertion of hypernyms is reﬂective of the readership at
which an abstract is directed, and of author’s effort to make explicit unfamiliar knowledge to
novice readers.

Emphatic both

Just What May be Deleted or Compressed in Abstracting?

Content selected for inclusion in an abstract may be presumed to be important, and hence, do
not require further emphasis. However, to draw a attention to important points, especially if
the material is expected to be unfamiliar, emphatics may equally be retained. As with lexical
words, emphatic redundant function words, e.g. both, too may be deleted (see (12)), or
retained (see (13)).

(12) Beth undertakers and guards were less likely to engage inx behavior typical of, young bees

thanz food storers and wax workers. [D-3 -2]
A (1) Guards and undertakers were less likely to performx behavior normally associated
with, young bees compared toz food storers and wax workers. [A-1-6; bes2-9741151]

3.2 Compression

An alternative way to condense is to compress complex linguistic units (with multiple lexical
units) into simpler units (see underscored text in bold).

3.2.1 Vsupport + N A ¢ + V0(N)

In the first group of compressible units, the verb in a VERB+NOUN collocation is semantically
empty. The whole verbal complex (vsuppcrt + N) may be compressed by deleting Vsuppm, and
replacing the noun, N, with its verbal derivation, Vo(N), e. g. to cause decreaseN A to
decreasev. The meaning of the complex is essentially unchanged. Substitution of the derived
verb with a synonym usually optionally follows (see (13)).

(13) The presence of fish caused decreases in both mating frequency and mating duration, ..[R-6-3]
A The presence of ﬁsh Q reduced both the number of matings  and mean mating durations.
[A-1-15; oec2-971 1725 8]

3.2.2 Catenative + VERB,,,,,,_ﬁ,,,-3., A VERB

The second group of compressible units involve a catenative. A catenative is “a lexical verb
which governs the non-finite form of another lexical verb” (Crystal, 1997). During
abstracting, a catenative which is not semantically empty, may in few and restricted cases be
replaced by the non-finite verb if its deletion does not bring about a change in meaning. Note
that it is not always possible to know linguistically if the change in meaning is marginal.
While X was allowed to hatch may be condensed to X hatched, we may or may not condense
X tend to move to X move. Only the author-researcher knows if a catenative may be deleted.

While both groups of compressible units just discussed are uncommon in the study
corpus (only one example per two documents), it merits an investigation as it involves
determinate situations, and may be pertinent in other corpus type. While catenatives are often
associated with phasal verbs, e. g. to start/continue/stop to VERB, only one example was found
in the study.

3.2.3 Derivation, Compound Noun Formation, and Prepositional Phrase Formation

Besides verbal phrases, other groups of words may also be variously compressed by a mix of
processes including derivation, e. g. nominalization and adjectivalization, and compound noun
formation (see (15)). In (16), note the verb deleted from the VERB+PREPOSITION complex.

4 Concluding Remarks

Linguistic units commonly deleted include illocution markers containing first person
pronouns, connectives, parenthetical texts, apposed texts and repetitions. While deletion of
such linguistic units may be a first step in condensation, multiple deletions of such units alone
can signiﬁcantly abridge a text without critical loss in core content. However, the situation is
usually much more complicated than implied in (18).

—> although (1) temperature (1) had some (1) effect <])_ [A-l-10; oec2-98117420]

While an investigation into factors critical for reliable identification of dispensable
units is invaluable to condensation, other studies should include the extent to which an
author’s presence may be deleted, and deletion in N1-of-N2 constructions according to noun
type, in general and in other domains. Pending such long-term studies, short-term projects can
find units which may be deleted or compressed. A list of nouns for which behavior is its
hypemym is also useful.
