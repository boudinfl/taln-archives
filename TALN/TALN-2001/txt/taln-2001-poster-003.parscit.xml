A catenative is “a lexical verb which governs the non-finite form of another lexical verb” (Crystal, 1997). During abstracting, a catenative which is not semantically empty, may in few and restricted cases be replaced by the non-finite verb if its deletion does not bring about a change in meaning. Note that it is not always possible to know linguistically if the change in meaning is marginal. While X was allowed to hatch may be condensed to X hatched, we may or may not condense X tend to move to X move. Only the author-researcher knows if a catenative may be deleted. While both groups of compressible units just discussed are uncommon in the study corpus (only one example per two documents), it mer</context>
