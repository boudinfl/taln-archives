Résumé — Abstract

Nous appliquons la désambiguisation du sens des mot aux deﬁnitions d'un dictionnaire
explicatif espagnol. Pour calculer le grand nombre de sens de mot en se basant sur le contexte
(qui, dans notre cas, est la deﬁnition du dictionnaire), nous employons une modiﬁcation de
l'algorithme de Lesk. L'algorithme originel compare les mots pour savoir si ils appartiennent a
un méme lexeme ou non; notre modiﬁcation consiste en une comparaison ﬂoue employant un
grand dictionnaire de synonyme et un systeme de morphologie dérivationnelle simple.
L'application de la désambiguisation aux deﬁnitions de dictionnaire (par contraste avec des
textes habituels) permet quelques simpliﬁcations de l'algorithme (par exemple, nous ne nous
soucions pas de la taille de la fenétre de contexte).

Mots-clefs: désambiguisation du sens des mot, usage des ressources linguistiques, algorithme
de Lesk, comparaisonﬂoue.

We apply word sense disambiguation to the definitions in a Spanish explanatory dictionary.
To calculate the scores of word senses basing on the context (which in our case is the
dictionary definition), we use a modification of Lesk’s algorithm. The algorithm relies on a
comparison between two words. In the original Lesk’s algorithm, the comparison is trivial:
two words are either the same lexeme or not; our modiﬁcation consists in fuzzy (weighted)
comparison using a large synonym dictionary and a simple derivational morphology system.
Application of disambiguation to dictionary definitions (in contrast to usual texts) allows for
some simpliﬁcations of the algorithm, e.g., we do not have to care of context window size.

Keywords: word sense disambiguation, usage of linguistic resources, Lesk’s algorithm, fuzzy
comparison.

1 Introduction

An explanatory dictionary defines words through definitions composed of other words, e.g.,
bank is a ﬁnancial institute. This looks like a relation between the deﬁning words and the
words being defined. But it is not: in fact, what is defined are not words but word senses:
bankl is a ﬁnancial institute, while bank; is the edge of a river. However, the defining words
are (in existing dictionaries) still strings rather than senses: in the definition of bankl, is
institute a school, a research center, a social structure, or an organization? Any NLP
application of an explanatory dictionary requires sense disambiguation (VVSD) in such
definitions.

The problem of WSD is well investigated. The prevailing approaches are knowledge-poor
statistical approaches (Manning and Shutze, 1999) based on bayesian classifiers, neural
networks, support vector machines, and other purely statistical techniques.

On the other hand, knowledge-rich approaches were suggested as early as in (Lesk, 1986) and
(Hirst, 1987). An advantage of knowledge-rich approaches is their clarity and explicitness: it
is easy to see why the algorithm makes a decision and on what information the decision is
based. Additionally, as more lexical resources become available, knowledge-rich approaches
become more affordable. Because of this, some recent works have presented modifications of
the original Lesk’s algorithm based on the use of thesaurus, synonym dictionaries, different
kinds of morphological normalization, etc. (VVilks and Stevenson, 1998, 1999), (Mahesh et
al., 1997), (Cowie et al., 1992), (Yarowsky, 1992), (Pook and Catlett, 1988).

In Lesk’s algorithm, a word sense is represented as the set of strings that form the definition
of the sense: e.g., bankl = {“ﬁnanciaf’, “institute”}. The algorithm calculates the scores of a
word sense on the basis of the intersection of this set with the senses of the words in the
context and chooses the sense with the best scores. We improved the algorithm by introducing
fuzzy comparison between such strings based on the use of a large synonym dictionary and
derivational morphological normalization.

We apply this improved algorithm to a large Spanish explanatory dictionary (30000 entries).
This dictionary is not as “good” dictionary with restricted defining vocabulary as, for
example, Longman Dictionary of Contemporary English.

Note that WSD in dictionary definitions is greatly simplified as compared with
disambiguation applied to a usual text because in this case (1) tagging (which is usually the
first step in WSD) is simplified since definitions are structured texts; also, the information on
the grammatical category of the headword helps tagging; (2) all words in a definition are
known to be related with the headword just because they are parts of its deﬁnition; and (3) the
problem of context window size is not relevant since the whole definition is used.

In the rest of the paper, we will first describe the algorithm, then discuss the obtained results,
and finally draw some conclusions.

2 The main algorithm

For each word (string) in each deﬁnition, we look up this word in the same dictionary. If for
this word there are several senses in the dictionary, the problem consists in the choice of the
most plausible one. Our algorithm for the solution of this problem consists in two stages:
preprocessing and scoring. Then, for each word, the sense with best scores is chosen.

Preprocessing. This stage consists of tagging (determining the part of speech of each word)
and normalization (reducing of the word to a standard form). For tagging, we use a set of
syntactic heuristics developed specifically for this Spanish dictionary. Some of the heuristics
deal with the syntactic structure of a sentence, for example: a word preceded by an article
(other than el) cannot be a verb. Another type of heuristics uses knowledge of the definition
structure, for example: in the definition of a noun, the first word is a noun. For normalization,
we use a morphological system that reduces the words to a standard form, preserving its part
of speech (like teaches, taught, teaching —> (to) teach).

Scoring. We represent each word sense as the set of words (except stopwords) that form its
definition. Let for a word (string) w in a definition of some sense (represented as a set h),
several senses (represented as sets s1, ..., s,,) are found in the dictionary. As the score of each
sense s,-, we use the proximity measure between s,- with h defined as follows. Let a, b be two

sets of words (strings), then the proximity measure w (a, b) =21,“ yEbw(x, y), where w (x, y)

is the proximity measure between two words defined as follows.

If x= y, then w (x, y) = 1. Otherwise, if x is a synonym of y or y is a synonym of x, then
w (x, y) = 0.5. Otherwise, if the initial parts (at least 5 letters long) of the two words coincide
(e.g., x =presidente and y =presidir), we consider such words derivates of each other. The
latter represents a very simple model of derivational morphology, which of course can be
improved in the future. In this case also w (x, y) = 0.5. Otherwise, w (x, y) = 0.

3 Experimental results

We applied our algorithm to a Spanish dictionary of about 30000 entries, with the average
number of words (except stopwords) per definitions being about 5. As a baseline, we also
implemented and applied to the same dictionary two other algorithms: (1) the original Lesk’s
algorithm (without any fuzzy comparison, i.e., with w (x, y) = 1.0 when x = y and w (x, y) = 0
otherwise) and (2) an algorithm that always chooses the first sense of the word.

Then we randomly chose 50 headwords and manually verified the results for their definitions.
Our algorithm disambiguated incorrectly 13% of correctly tagged ambiguous words (i.e.,
without counting unambiguous words and words incorrectly tagged by the tagger). This is
one-fourth better than the original Lesk’s algorithm, which produced 17% of errors, and twice
better than that for the algorithm that always chooses the first sense, which produced 29% of
errors. (With counting also unambiguous words, these ﬁgures were 12%, 16%, and 28% of
errors, correspondingly.)

In our test program, 92% of words were correctly tagged, the majority of errors consisting in
confusing nouns and adj ectives; clearly, for incorrectly tagged words correct disambiguation
was impossible, this is why we did not count them in the statistics above. Incorrect part of

speech tagging of a word did not affect much the disambiguation results for the other words
in the same definition because of our morphologically-based comparison and because usually
(in 75% of cases in our experiments) there is a little difference in the definition of a noun and
the corresponding adjective.

Let us look at two examples of the algorithm results. In the definitions of word senses we give
in parenthesis the words that were used in scoring. The words between < > are the synonyms
that were found, the words between [ ] are the words used in the definition of the word that is
a part of the main definition. Between { } there are words that were scored because they were
detected by the morphological model (substring comparison). Also we give the English
translation of each Spanish phrase. The first example is for the word:

glandula : o'rgano que segrega sustancias indispensables para el organismo.
(glandula : an organ that segregates indispensable substances for an organism).

In this case the word o'rgano (organ) can have 4 meanings.

l. ([sustancia]) Instrumento de viento, compuesto de un teclado y de un sistema de tubos
por donde se emite el sonido.
(([substance]) Wind instrument that is made of the clavier and a system of tubes which
produces a sound)

2. ([organismo], [organismo], <organismo>,<entidad>) Parte de un animal 0 planta que
tiene una entidad en si misma y realiza una funcio'n propia, como, por ejemplo, el
esto'mago.

(([organism], [organism], <organism>,<entity>) Part of an animal or a plant that is a
unit itself and has its own function, like, for example, a stomach.)

3. ([organismo], ) Cada una de las secciones del Estado, 0 de una empresa, con funcio'n
propia.
(([organism]) Each one of the sections of a state or an enterprise that has its own
function.)

4. ([organismo]) Parte de una maquina que realiza una funcio'n especiﬁca.
(([organism]) Part of a machine that has a speciﬁc function.)

None of the words used in the word senses intersects directly with the main definition. Still
the second sense got the greatest score because there are two words that have synonyms:
organism and entity (namely, these words have each other as synonyms), besides, two words
(plant and animal) have in their definitions the word organism. We use the latter fact
basically to choose the correct sense in case of the equal scores, since we assign to it very
small weight. In case of the first sense the word tube has in its definition the word substance.
In the third and the fourth senses the word function has in its definition the word organism.

The other example is for a word:

operacio'n : Negociacio'n con valores bancarios.
(operation : negotiation with banking values.)

In this definition the word valor (value) can have one of the 11 meanings.

10.

11.

It can be seen that the sense which got the maximum score is the sense 10 because it has a
morphological derivative (negotiable vs negotiation) and two words which have the word

() Precio, cualidad de las cosas por la que se paga cierta cantidad
(() Price, quality of things for which something is paid.)

(<valor>) Signiﬁcado o importancia de algo dicho, escrito, etc.
((<value>) Significance, importance of something said, written, etc.)

() Cualidad del que no teme elpeligro.
(() Quality of do not be afraid of a danger.)

() Equivalencia, especialmente en monedas con respecto alas tomadas como patron.

(() Equivalence, especially of coins, with the respect to a standard one.)

(<valor>,) Grado de utilidad, importancia o buenas cualidades de algo.
((<value>) Degree of utility, importance or good qualities of something.)

(<valor>,) Atrevimiento, desvergiienza.
(<courage> Insolence, impudence.)

() F irmeza, integridad.
(() F irmness, integrity.)

() Eﬁcacia.
(() Eﬂiciency.)

() Duracio'n de una nota musical.
(() Duration of a musical note.)

({negoci}, <valor>, <valor>) Acciones, bonos o cualesquiera documentos
negociables, acreditativos de una propiedad.

(( {negoti}, <value>, <value>) Shares, bonus or any negotiable documents,
accrediting a property.)

() Persona que posee cualidades positivas para algo determinado.
(() A person who has certain positive qualities for something determined).

value as their synonym, namely share and document. The other senses have less scores.

4 Conclusions

We have suggested an improvement of Lesk’s algorithm and applied it to a large Spanish
explanatory dictionary. Our improvements consist in fuzzy comparison of words using a
synonym dictionary and a simple derivational morphology procedure. Also, application of
disambiguation to dictionary definitions (as compared with usual texts) allows for
considerable simplification of the algorithm. Our algorithm gives better results than the

original Lesk’s algorithm and the baseline algorithm.
