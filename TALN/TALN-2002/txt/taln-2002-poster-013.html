<p>Abstract 
</p>
<p>We present an automatic text generation system (ATG) developed for the generation of 
natural language text for automatically produced test items. This ATG has been developed to 
work with an automatic item generation system for analytical reasoning items for use in tests 
with high-stakes outcomes (such as college admissions decisions). As such, the development 
and implementation of this ATG is couched in the context and goals of automated item 
generation for educational assessment.

<p>1 Introduction 
</p>
<p>There is a significant research effort at Educational Testing Service (ETS) directed at the 
development of techniques for the automatic generation of test items in various types of 
assessment, including mathematics, verbal, and analytical reasoning applications.  The 
potential benefits of such automatic item generation capabilities are substantial.  The field of 
testing for high-stakes decisions places significant demands on the item generation 
capabilities of even large corporations.  The potential for test items to be memorized and 
distributed to other examinees limits the number of times an item can be administered before 
it must be &#8216;retired&#8217; and no longer used.  When the test is a large-scale nationwide 
examination, such as the SAT or the GRE1, with thousands of examinees per year this

</p>
<p>are two national standardized tests: see http://www.ets.org/tests.html.

</p>
<p>exposure limitation demands that there be a constant production line of new items to replace 
items that have been administered many times.   
</p>
<p>The high number of items that must be continuously &#8216;retired&#8217; and replaced in large scale 
assessment creates a great need for a continuous item supply.  At the same time, the rigorous 
review and pretesting processes that items are subjected to typically result in substantial time 
delay between writing and administering items. Therefore, automated item generation 
systems that are capable of automatically producing items, ensuring that the language of such 
items is appropriate, and providing an accurate prediction of the statistical characteristics of 
the item is of significant value to test development. 
</p>
<p>We will be presenting an ATG system aimed at creating &#8216;ready to use&#8217; items for analytical 
reasoning tests (as used in the GRE). We will also show how the linguistic data and templates 
used in the generation process are distinct from the generation algorithms.  This separation of 
data and templates from the source code facilitates maintenance and updating of the system as 
well as the adaptability to multiple languages (e.g. to date, this potential has been explored 
with English and French). 
</p>
<p>2 Analytical Reasoning Items 
</p>
<p>An analytical reasoning item (see Figure 1 for a human-written AR item retired from the 
GRE)2 is typically composed of several elements.  The initial element is the scenario, the 
situation description, that serves as part of the context, which &#8220;contextualizes&#8221; the exercise. 
The first paragraph (plain text) in Figure 1 is the initial scenario.  As part of this scenario the 
number of objects, the elements to be manipulated (e.g. radio programs), and slots, the 
placement opportunities for the objects (e.g. radio program sequence), are specified.  The 
context also includes a set of restriction rules that place constraints on the relationships in the 
context.  In Figure 1, the restriction rules are provided in italics.  The scenario and restriction 
rules jointly comprise the context.  The actual AR item stem refers to the context and poses a 
particular question the examinee must solve3.  In Figure 1 the AR item stem, which introduces 
an additional restriction rule, follows the context and is underlined.  Immediately following 
the item stem is a series of options (the choices in a multiple choice item), which are bulleted 
in Figure 1.  One of these options is the key (the third option in Figure 1), a correct response 
to the item stem and the only option which satisfies all the given rules, while the remaining 
options are incorrect, or distracters. The examinee must use their analytical reasoning skills 
to consider all restriction rules and select the key.  The item stem and the options, in 
combination, represent the AR item. There are typically multiple items that refer to a single 
context which, taken together constitute an item set.  There are usually numerous such AR 
sets in an assessment that uses these items. 
</p>

2 Figure 1 item is a particular subtype of AR item called linear ordering. 
3 For AR items there are three types of questions to appear in item stems:  to indicate which of the following 
</p>
<p>options can be true, must be true or cannot be true, in accordance with the given restriction rules.

</p>
<p>A popular radio show has exactly six segments--film 
review, interview, news, political essay, song, and 
weather--that are aired consecutively, one after another, 
from first through sixth, without intervening material.  
Each segment is aired exactly once and in a manner 
consistent with the following restrictions: 
 
The song must be aired earlier than the interview. 
The news and the song must be aired consecutively. 
The weather and the film review must be aired 
consecutively. 
The interview cannot be aired consecutively with the 
weather. 
The interview cannot be the next segment aired after the 
song. 
 
</p>
<p>If the political essay is the next segment aired after the 
song, which one of the following can be true? 
 
&#8226; The film review is the fourth segment aired. 
&#8226; The film review is the sixth segment aired. 
&#8226; The interview is the fourth segment aired. 
&#8226; The interview is the fifth segment aired. 
&#8226; The weather is the fifth segment aired. 
 
</p>
<p>Figure 1: Example of an Analytical Reasoning Item 
</p>
<p>It is apparent that the syntax and the lexicon used are simple and rather repetitive, even to the 
point of appearing peculiar if taken out of context. This is the result of adherence to strict 
item-writing processes for AR items and while the result provides a poor example of 
naturalistic writing, it adheres to a fixed format for AR items in assessment and provides a 
standardized item format that facilitates examinee understanding and performance on multiple 
instances of such items.  As such, this adherence to fixed structure helps to control the item 
difficulty by restricting the language structure.    
</p>
<p>3 Goal and needs 
</p>
<p>The goal of our ATG system is, for a given scenario, to generate the natural language for 
restriction rules to complete the context and then generate the required number of natural 
language items (item stems and options) to complete the item set.  The scenarios themselves 
are not automatically generated but are stored in a digital database library and, upon 
generation of the abstract structure (see section 3.2) for the restriction rules, item stems and 
options, are accessed to determine the appropriate scenario to select and &#8216;clothe&#8217; the 
generated abstract representations.    
</p>
<p>In the terminology of computer-based testing (CBT) automated item generation offers a new 
approach to item banking4.  Using automated item generation the creation of test forms is not 
restricted to selection of items from a pre-existing item database but instead, for any scenario 
contained in the item bank, the system is able to generate hundreds of items, each with known 
statistical characteristics based on generation principles.  In fact, this approach is equivalent 
to having an item bank containing all possible items, each with known statistical properties.  
</p>
<p>From the NLG point of view, our system is a hybrid system including Templates (Reiter, 
1995) and aspects of NLG systems. 
</p>
<p>                                                          
4 &#8220;Item banking covers any procedures that are used to create pilot, analyze, store, manage and select test items 
</p>
<p>so that multiple test forms can be created from subsets of the total &#8220;bank&#8221; of items.&#8221; (Brown, 1997 p. 44).

<p>3.1 Abstract representation of the item 
</p>
<p>A collaboration between Plymouth University and ETS has produced a system that 
automatically generates the fundamental abstract representation of AR items (Dennis, 
</p>
<p>Handley, Bradon, Evans, &amp; Newstead, 2002).  Specifically, by 
establishing abstract representations of the number of objects 
</p>
<p>slots, the initialization rules, the stem rule, and the options.  
example of this representation of an item, transformed into 
</p>
<p> encoding for communication with the ATG, can be found 
as Figure 2 corresponding to the same item presented in Figure 
</p>
<p>his system was completed prior to the work on the ATG for 
thing&#8221; these abstract representations in natural language.

 &lt;RULE&gt;latB5&lt;/RULE&gt; 
 &lt;RULE&gt;latF5&lt;/RULE&gt; 
&lt;/OPTIONS&gt; 
&lt;/ITEM&gt;

</p>
<p>h of the rules is formed with an operator (e.g. abo, adj, lat, 
)5 and a couple of objects (the elements to be ordered). Rules 
</p>
<p>can be coordinated (e.g. exclusive disjunction, symbolized by X, 
conjunction, symbolized by A, etc.).  For example: X aboCA 
aboAF expresses an exclusive disjunction of two rules: aboCA 
and aboAF.  Rules can also be modified with a not operator (N).  
</p>
<p>By combining rules and variables, the abstract representations developed by Plymouth 
University can generate a very large number of valid formal relationships to be expressed in 
items. 
</p>
<p>3.2 Scenario data bank 
</p>
<p>As previously indicated, the scenarios used in the &#8216;clothing&#8217; process are stored in a database.  
This library would contain a large number of hand-written scenarios, formatted in XML, and 
manually encoded series of lexical units for each scenario (to be used in the templates). 
Future research will address the development of a component that automates the selection of 
lexical information compatible with the scenario.

</p>
<p>4 Wording process 
</p>
<p>The wording process of the items is based on three elements: an abstract representation of the 
objects and rules (provided by the Plymouth system), some lexical information (related to the 
scenario and hand-coded in the database) and a finite-state grammar that describes, for each 
</p>
<p>type of rule, some possible syntactic structures. The 
wording process is conducted as follows: 
</p>
<p>1) the formal representation of the item is combined with 
the context and its lexical data in a single XML 
document that will be fed to the system (&#8216;XML&#8217; in 
Fig. 4). Basically, the resulting XML document is a 
combination of the texts presented in Fig. 2 and 3; 
</p>
<p>2) a XML parser (&#8216;READ&#8217; in Fig. 4) reads the document, 
combines the rules (a step called factorization, 
performed in accordance with the difficulty model) 
and produces a linear output (one line for each natural 
language sentence to produce, see Fig. 5). At this 
point, each of these lines bear all the lexical elements 
that will be needed to complete the templates (an 
example of this output is provided as Fig. 5);  
</p>
<p>3) the template (a finite state transducer represented as 
an INTEX 6 graph, see Fig. 6) is applied on the 
intermediary text representation and generates the 
sentences in natural language. That realization

<p>The role of the transducers is to a) identify patterns in the intermediary text representation 
(displayed in Figure 5) ; b) to fill some variables with parts of the matched text (delimited by 
the large parenthesis in the graph) and c) to produce an output. The output of the graph is the 
text written below the boxes (see Fig. 6). For example, the Fig. 6 graph applied on the Fig. 5 
intermediary text will match the first line of the text (which is an ABO rule) and produce the 
output &#8220;$6 must be $2 $4 $7&#8221; where $x variables are replaced by their content (the 
corresponding &#8220;words&#8221; identified in the intermediary text representation). 
</p>
<p>5 Conclusion 
</p>
<p>Template-based methods are often perceived as a poor procedure for full-scale NLG systems. 
For example, Langklide (1998) says that &#8220;templates only work in very controlled or limited 
situations&#8221; and that they cannot provide &#8220;the expressiveness, flexibility or scalability that 
many real domains need&#8221;.  Despite this perception our investigations demonstrated that they 
offer accurate control on the generated text (a crucial element in the context of test 
development), they are easy to build and to adapt to different languages. So, as Reiter (1995) 
has previously concluded, we decided that &#8220;NLG shouldn&#8217;t get in the way&#8221; and we have 
opted for a goal-oriented approach.  This approach decidedly fulfills the &#8220;real domain needs&#8221; 
we have defined and does so in a less costly manner that is easier to monitor at every step of 
the processing. In summary, the ATG system is proving to be quite adequate for the purpose 
of generating text for AR items and is a vital component of a fully functioning automatic item 
generation system.  Such a system would be of significant utility to large scale testing 
programs by: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Dramatically increasing item production capability to permit replacement of retired items;   
&#8226; Refining the quality of items for administration by implementing generation controls on 
</p>
<p>the language used for the item; 
&#8226; Provision of a priori statistical characteristics of items, thus permitting completely 
</p>
<p>autonomous test generation on-the-fly, even for Computerized Adaptive Testing.

<p>Together, these automated item generation elements (abstract representation, natural language 
generation, and difficulty modeling) offer tantalizing possibilities for the future of test 
production, made possible by the contributions of this ATG system.7
