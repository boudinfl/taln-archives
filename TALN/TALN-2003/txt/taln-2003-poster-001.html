</p>
<p>Le but des syste&#768;mes de question-re&#769;ponse est de trouver des re&#769;ponses exactes et factuelles a&#768; des
questions exprime&#769;es en langue naturelle en recherchant dans une grande collection de docu-
ments. Notre recherche vise pluto&#770;t a&#768; ge&#769;ne&#769;rer des re&#769;ponses comple&#768;tes, sous forme de phrases,
e&#769;tant donne&#769;e la re&#769;ponse exacte. La ge&#769;ne&#769;ration de telles phrases-re&#769;ponses est une ta&#770;che im-
portante car ces phrases peuvent e&#770;tre employe&#769;es par un syste&#768;me de question-re&#769;ponse pour
ame&#769;liorer la recherche de re&#769;ponses exactes ou bien, pour ame&#769;liorer l&#8217;interface entre le syste&#768;me et
l&#8217;utilisateur en fournissant des re&#769;ponses plus naturelles. Suite a&#768; une e&#769;tude de corpus de phrases-
re&#769;ponses, nous avons de&#769;veloppe&#769; un ensemble de patrons syntaxiques de re&#769;ponses correspondant
a&#768; chaque patron syntaxique de question.

<p>The goal of Question-Answering (QA) systems is to find short and factual answers to open-
domain questions by searching a large collection of documents. The subject of this research is
to formulate complete and natural answer-sentences to questions, given the short answer. The
answer-sentences are meant to be self-sufficient; that is, they should contain enough context to
be understood without needing the original question. Generating such sentences is important in
question-answering as they can be used to enhance existing QA systems to provide answers to
the user in a more natural way and to provide a pattern to actually extract the answer from the
document collection.

<p>1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The goal of Question-Answering (QA) systems is to find short and factual answers to open-
domain questions by searching a large collection of documents. The subject of our research is
to formulate complete and natural answer-sentences to questions, given the short answer. The
answer-sentences are meant to be self-sufficient; that is, they should contain enough context to
be understood without needing the original question. Figure 1 shows an example of a question,</p>

such sentences is important in question-answering as they can be used to enhance existing QA
systems to provide answers to the user in a more natural way and to provide a pattern to actually
extract the answer from the document collection.
</p>
<p>2 Previous Work in Answer Formulation
</p>
<p>To date, most work in QA has been involved in answer extraction; that is, locating the answer in
a document collection. In contrast, the problem of answer formulation has not received much
attention. Answer formulation performed to improve interaction with the user aims for high
precision by producing only a few formulations of good linguistic quality. However, to our
knowledge, little research has yet addressed this issue.
</p>
<p>To improve answer extraction, for example, when looking for the answer to What country is the
biggest producer of tungsten? and knowing that the answer could have the form The biggest
producer of tungsten is &lt;LOCATION&gt; or &lt;LOCATION&gt; is the biggest producer of tung-
sten, the QA system can search for these formulations in the document collection and instantiate
&lt;LOCATION&gt;with the matching noun phrase. This technique is now used in several QA sys-
tems such as (de Chalendar et al., 2002; Soubbotin &amp; Soubbotin, 2001; Plamondon et al., 2002;
Duclaye et al., 2002). In the work of (Brill et al., 2001; Brill et al., 2002), the system searches
the web for a list of possible answer formulations generated by permuting the words of the ques-
tions and in (Agichtein &amp; Gravano, 2000; Lawrence &amp; Giles, 1998), answer formulations are
produced specifically to improve the retrieval of documents, not the retrieval of exact answers.
</p>
<p>Most work on question reformulation has worked at the word level; whether using simple word
permutations or including lexical variations, such as synonyms. However, reformulations that
take into account syntactic information, has, to our knowledge not been investigated. This is
probably due to the fact that most work has not been performed for the generation of self-
sufficient answer-sentences.
</p>
<p>3 Corpus Analysis
</p>
<p>To capture and analyze the variety of answer formulations for various types of questions (What,
Which, When, Where, Who, Name, How and Why) and their corresponding answer-sentence;
we designed a survey composed of 150 questions and exact answers, taken from the TREC-8,</p>

</p>
<p>TREC-9 and TREC-10 competitions (Voorhees &amp; Harman, 1999; Voorhees &amp; Harman, 2000;
Voorhees &amp; Harman, 2001) and asked 40 people to formulate a complete and natural sentence-
long answer that would best answer each of these questions. The answers obtained from the
survey were compiled and classified according to their syntactic form. Figure 2 shows an ex-
ample of this compilation. We found a great variety of answer formulations for questions of
type What, Name and Why and these tended to have a more complex structure including one
or more prepositional phrases. The other types of questions had fewer variations; the answers
were more stereotypical.
</p>
<p>Once we compiled the answers for each question, both the questions and the answers were
tagged using the Brill part-of-speech Tagger (Brill, 1995) and two main syntactic constituents:
noun phrases (NP) using NPExtractor (Bergler &amp; Knoll, 1996) and prepositional phrases (PP).
In addition answer patterns include an extra tag (denoted AA) to indicate the position of the
exact answer, and also include supplemental grammatical words and verb tense information
needed to create well-formed sentences. For example, to answer the question What year did
WWII begin?, a possible answer would be WWII began (past tense) +in AA. The result of the
analysis is a set of answer patterns for each possible question pattern. Table 1 shows results of
this process for questions of type Who and What.
</p>
<p>Due to the variety of questions, the number of question patterns found is considerable (for 150
questions, 92 patterns were found), which makes us consider that the evaluation of fewer types
of questions would have been preferable to obtain a more representative number of patterns for
each type of question. Table 2 shows the distribution of patterns for each type of questions.
Questions of type Name, Which, Why and How were rather few and have a great difference in
their formulations.</p>

</p>
<p>4 Implementation and Evaluation
</p>
<p>To test our model, we implemented the patterns in a system called AnsForm. AnsForm pro-
ceeds to automatically extract the tags and the words of a given tagged question from the test
corpus, creates a pattern and match it with the question patterns identified from our training set.
If a counterpart is found, the system checks the answer patterns associated with the matched
question and automatically generates an answer-sentence as the output.
</p>
<p>4.1 Evaluation
</p>
<p>To evaluate the performance of our approach, we ran the system with a test corpus made up of
120 questions (and their exact answers) taken from the TREC-8, TREC-9 and TREC-10 ques-
tion corpus. Considering recall as a measure of coverage (quantity); how many questions from
the test set did match question patterns identified from our training set, and precision as a mea-
sure of accuracy (quality); how many answer formulation were grammatically correct, we found
that the system has only 47% of recall and 88% of precision. This is shown in Table 3. The low
coverage of our system is due to the large variety of types of question formulations (8) that we
analyzed and the inherent difficulties in gathering a representative training corpus. Because our
training set is about the same size as our test set, we do not have a more representative number
of patterns for each type of question.
</p>
<p>Questions of type How, where the system performed poorly (37% of recall), is an example of
the direct relation between the variety of type of question formulation, question patterns and the</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Generation of natural responses in question-answering
</p>
<p>coverage of a question. Although we have a large number of patterns for this type of question
(see Table 2), the variation of this type into several categories such as How long, How many,
How much, How tall . . . makes the 20 patterns too few to cover different formulations. It is
interesting to note, however, that questions of type Where were always well-reformulated even
if we have only three (3) patterns for this type. We believe that this is because Where questions
have a more stereotypical structure.
</p>
<p>4.2 Error Analysis
</p>
<p>As shown in table 3, on average, 88% of the answer-sentences that were generated were gram-
matically correct. Some of the errors can be blamed on the tagging process: Brill&#8217;s tagger has
not been adapted to tag questions, and our own noun phrase extractor does not tag correctly cer-
tain types of noun phrases like conjunctive NPs. However, other errors were due directly to our
approach. We assumed that if two questions share the same syntactic pattern, then they should
also share identical syntactic patterns for their answer-sentences. In general, this assumption
holds. For example, the questions:What/WP persons head/NP is/VBZ on a dime/PP?/. and
What/WP soviet seaport/NP is/VBZ on the Black Sea/PP ?/ share the same question pattern
(WP NP VBZ PP) and can both be answered by the following patterns:
</p>
<p>Pattern Example
AA VBZ PP AA is on a dime.
</p>
<p>AA is on the Black Sea.
+the NP +that VBZ PP +is AA The person&#8217;s head that is on a dime is AA.
</p>
<p>The soviet seaport that is on the Black Sea is AA.
AA VBZ +the NP PP AA is the person&#8217;s head on a dime.
</p>
<p>AA is the soviet seaport on the Black Sea.
+the NP PP VBZ AA The person&#8217;s head on a dime is AA.
</p>
<p>The soviet seaport on the Black Sea is AA.
</p>
<p>However, in some cases, different questions may share the same grammatical pattern, but cannot
use the same answer pattern. For example: Who/WP was/VBD Galileo/NP ?/ and Who/WP
discovered/VBD radium/NP ?/ both share the pattern (WP VBD NP); but while the second
question can be answered by NP +was VBD +by AA: Radium +was discovered +by AA, the
first cannot use the same answer pattern as:Galileo +was was +by AA is not grammatically
correct. A solution to this problem would be to assign different tags to different types of verbs
in order to produce distinct patterns for each case.
</p>
<p>5 Conclusion and Future Work
</p>
<p>The answer formulation approach presented in this paper shows that patterns that include syn-
tactic information can effectively produce answer-sentences for most of the matched questions.
Our evaluation shows that with the small training corpus that we used (150 questions) only
about a half of the test corpus could be covered. We believe that with a larger training corpus,
the recall rate could be increased significantly. However, our goal is not to have high coverage,
but have high grammatical precision. We are more interested in generating answer-sentences for
human interface reasons, than for extraction purposes. Our work only considered self-suffcient
answer-sentences, but if the question is also given to the user, we should consider the treatment
of language phenomena such as ellipsis and anaphora. Also to improve the AnsForm system
itself, it would be useful to train the part-of-speech tagger and the noun phrase extractor on</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Anaya, Kosseim
</p>
<p>questions, so as to reduce tagging errors and to concentrate on a smaller set of question types.
To improve the approach in general we believe that using only part-of-speech tags and a few
syntactic tags are not sufficient; semantic information must be taken into account. For exam-
ple, we should distinguish verb classes and identify semantic types of prepositional phrases
(ex. temporal, locative, . . . ) which cannot be placed in the same syntactic positions to produce
answer-sentences.
