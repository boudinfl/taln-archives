Résumé - Abstract

Les Grammaires d’Arbres Adjoints (TAG) sont connues pour ne pas étre assez puissantes pour
traiter le brouillage d’ arguments dans des langues a ordre des mots libre. Les variantes TAG pro-
posées jusqu’a maintenant pour expliquer le brouillage ne sont pas entierement satisfaisantes.
Nous présentons ici une extension alternative de TAG, basée sur la notion du partage de noeuds.
En considerant des données de l’allemand et du coréen, on montre que cette extension de TAG
peut en juste proportion analyser des données de brouillage d’arguments, également en combi-
naison avec l’extraposition et la topicalisation.

Tree Adjoining Grammars (TAG) are known not to be powerful enough to deal with scrambling
in free word order languages. The TAG-variants proposed so far in order to account for scram-
bling are not entirely satisfying. Therefore, an alternative extension of TAG is introduced based
on the notion of node sharing. Considering data from German and Korean, it is shown that this
TAG-extension can adequately analyse scrambling data, also in combination with extraposition
and topicalization.

1 LTAG and scrambling

Lexicalized Tree Adjoining Grammars (LTAG, (Joshi & Schabes, 1997)) is a tree-rewriting
formalism. An LTAG consists of a ﬁnite set of trees (elementary trees) associated with lexical
items. Larger trees are derived by substitution (replacing a leaf with a new tree) and adjunction
(replacing an internal node with a new tree). In case of an adjunction, the new elementary tree
has a special leaf node, the foot node (marked with an asterisk). When adjoining such a tree (a
so-called auxiliary tree) to a node ,u, in the resulting tree, the subtree with root node ,u from the
old tree is put below the foot node of the new auxiliary tree. Non-auxiliary elementary trees are
called initial trees. LTAG elementary trees represent extended projections of lexical items and
encapsulate all syntactic arguments of the lexical anchor. They are minimal in the sense that
only the arguments of the anchor are encapsulated, all recursion is factored away.

Roughly, scrambling is the permutation of elements (arguments and adjuncts) of a sentence (we
use the term scrambling in a purely descriptive sense without implying any theory of move-
ment). A special case is long-distance scrambling where arguments or adjuncts of an embedded
inﬁnitive are ‘moved’ out of the embedded VP. This occurs for instance in languages such as
German, Hindi, Japanese and Korean. These languages are therefore often said to have a free
word order. Consider for example the German sentence (1). In (1), the accusative NP es is an
argument of the embedded inﬁnitive zu reparieren but it precedes der Mechaniker, the subject
of the main verb verspricht and it is not part of the embedded VP. In German there is no bound
on the number of scrambled elements and no bound on the depth of scrambling (i.e., in terms
of movement, the number of VP borders crossed by the moved element). (See for example
(Rambow, 1994; Meurers, 2000; Muller, 2002) for descriptions of scrambling data.)

(1)  dass [es]1 der Mechaniker [t1 zu reparieren] verspricht
 that it the mechanic to repair promises
‘... that the mechanic promises to repair it’

As shown in (Becker et al., 1991), TAG are not powerful enough to describe scrambling in
German in an adequate way. By this we mean that a TAG analysis of scrambling with the correct
predicate-argument structure is not possible, i.e., an analysis with each argument attaching to
the verb it depends on.

Let us consider the analysis of (1) in order to get an idea of why scrambling poses a problem for
TAG. If we leave aside the complementizer dass, elementary trees for verspricht and reparieren
might look as shown in Fig. 1. In the derivation, the verspricht-tree adjoins to the root of the
reparieren-tree and the NP der Mechaniker is substituted for the subject node of verspricht}
This leads to the third tree in Fig. 1. When adding es, there is a problem: it should be added to
reparieren since it is one of its arguments. But at the same time, it should precede Mechaniker,
i.e., it must be adjoined either to the root or to the NP,,,,m node in the derived tree. The root node
belongs to verspricht and the NPm,m node belongs to Mechaniker. Consequently, an adjunction
to one of them would not give the desired predicate-argument structure. If it was only for (1),
one could add a tree to the grammar for reparieren with a scrambled NP that allows adjunction
of verspricht between the NP and the verb. But as soon as there are several scrambled elements
that are arguments of different verbs, this does not work any longer. In general, it has been
shown (J oshi et al., 2000) that adopting speciﬁc elementary trees it is possible to deal with a

see for example (Gardent & Kalhneyer, 2003).

part of the difﬁcult data: TAG can describe scrambling up to depth 2 (two crossed VP borders).
But this is not sufﬁcient. Even though examples of scrambling of depth > 2 are rare, they can
occur (see Kulick, 2000).

Several TAG variants have been proposed for scrambling: Becker et al. (1991) propose non-
local MCTAG with additional dominance constraints. However, non-local MCTAG are too
powerful since it is generally assumed that they are not polynomially parsable. Another alter-
native is V-TAG (Rambow, 1994), a formalism with nicer formal properties. The problem of
V-TAG is that the expressive power of the formalism is probably too limited to deal with all nat-
ural language phenomena, since the formalism apparently cannot generate the copy language
(see Rambow, 1994, Conjecture 7, p. 78) and therefore seems not to be able to describe cross-
serial dependencies in Swiss German. D-tree substitution grammars (Rambow et al., 2001),
another TAG-variant one could use for scrambling, pose the same problem as V-TAG. Kulick
(2000) proposes Segmented Tree Adjoining Grammars for scrambling. This formalism uses a
rather complex operation on trees, segmented adjunction, that consists partly of a standard TAG
adjunction and partly of a kind of tree merging or tree uniﬁcation. In this operation, two different
things get mixed up, the resource-sensitive adjoining operation of standard TAG where subtrees
cannot be identiﬁed, and the completely different uniﬁcation operation. Another formalism re-
lated to TAG that has been claimed to be able to deal with scrambling is Range Concatenation
Grammar (RCG, (Boullier, 2000)). But the RCG scrambling analysis in (Boullier, 1999) as-
sumes predicate-argument dependencies between nouns and verbs to be already known before
parsing. However, these dependencies are exactly what one wants to ﬁnd out when doing the
analysis. With this information already given in advance, the analysis is of course easier. So
Boullier (1999) does not present a general anaysis of scrambling.

None of the above-mentioned formalisms is entirely satisfying for scrambling, and therefore
the question of how to extend TAG in order to deal with scrambling, is still an open problem.
In this paper we propose a TAG-variant that a) can deal with scrambling and other word order
variations, b) extends the generative capacity of TAG, i.e., the set of tree adjoining languages
(containing the copy language) is a subset of the languages it generates, and c) is polynomially
parsable if one imposes some additional restriction.

In section 2, tree-local MC-TAG with shared nodes (SN-MCTAG) and in particular restricted
SN-MCTAG (RSN-MCTAG) are introduced. Section 3 to 5 show the analyses of different word
order variations using this formalism, namely scrambling, extraposition and topicalization, con-
sidering data from German and Korean.

2 Tree-local MCTAG with shared nodes (SN-MCTAG)

To illustrate the idea of shared nodes, consider again example (1). In standard TAG, nodes
to which new elementary trees are adjoined or substituted disappear, i.e., they are replaced by

the new elementary tree. E. g., after the derivation steps shown in Fig. 1, the root node of the
reparieren tree does not exist any longer. It is replaced by the verspricht tree and its daughters
have become daughters of the foot node of the verspricht tree. I.e., the root node of the derived
tree is considered being part of only the verspricht tree. Therefore, an adjunction at that node
is an adjunction at the verspricht tree. However, this standard TAG view is not completely
justiﬁed: in the derived tree, the root node and the lower VP node might as well be considered
as belonging to reparieren since they are results of identifying the root node of reparieren with
the root and the foot node of verspricht.2 Therefore, we propose that the two nodes in question
belong to both, verspricht and reparieren. In other words, these nodes are shared by the two
elementary trees. Consequently, they can be used to add new elementary trees to verspricht and
(in contrast to standard TAG) also to reparieren.

We use a multicomponent TAG (MCTAG, J oshi, 1987; Weir, 1988). This means that the ele-
ments of the grammar are sets of elementary trees. In each derivation step, one of these sets
is chosen and the trees in this set are added simultaneously (by adjunction or substitution) to
different nodes in the already derived tree. We assume tree-locality, i.e., the nodes to which the
trees of such a set are added must all belong to the same elementary tree. Standard tree-local
MCTAGs are strongly equivalent to TAG but they allow to generate a richer set of derivation
structures. In combination with shared nodes, tree-local multicomponent derivation extends the
weak generative power of the grammar.

Let us go back to (1). Assume the tree set on the left of Fig. 2 for es. Adopting the idea of
shared nodes, this tree set can be added to reparieren using the root of the already derived
tree for adjunction of the ﬁrst tree and the NP,” node for substitution of the second tree. The
operation is tree-local since both nodes are part of the reparieren tree.

In general, the notion of shared nodes means the following: When substituting an elementary
tree 04 into an elementary tree 7, in the resulting tree, the root node of the subtree 04 is considered
being part of oz and of 7. When adjoining an elementary B at a node that is part of the elementary
trees 71, . . . , 7”, then in the resulting tree, the root and foot node of B are both considered being
part of 71, . . . ,7” and B. Consequently, if an elementary 7’ is added to an elementary 7 and if
there is then a sequence of adjunctions at root or foot nodes starting from 7’, then each of these
adjunctions can be considered as an adjunction at 7 since it takes place at a node shared by 7, 7’
and all the subsequently adjoined trees. In Fig. 2 for example the es-tree is adjoined to the root
of a tree that was adjoined to reparieren. Therefore this adjunction can be considered being an
adjunction at reparieren. An adjunction at a node where other trees already have been added

2Actua1ly, in a Feature—Structure Based TAG (FTAG, (Vijay—Shanker & J oshi, 1988)), the top feature structure
of the root of the derived tree is the uniﬁ cation of the top of the root of verspricht and the top of the root of
reparieren. The bottom feature structure of the lower VP node is the uniﬁ cation of the bottom of the foot of
verspricht and the bottom of the root of reparieren. In this sense, the root of the reparieren tree gets split into two
parts. The upper part merges with the root node of the verspricht tree and the lower part merges with the foot node
of the verspricht tree.

(e.g., this adjunction of es to the root of reparieren) is called a secondary adjunction while a
ﬁrst adjunction at a node is called a primary adjunction.

Concerning formal properties, SN-MCTAG is hard to compare to other local TAG-related for-
malisms since arbitrarily many trees can be added by secondary adjunction to a single elemen-
tary tree. Therefore, we deﬁne a restricted version, restricted SN-MCTAG (RSN-MCTAG) that
limits the number of secondary adjunctions to an elementary tree by allowing secondary ad-
junction only in combination with at least one simultaneous primary adjunction or substitution.
E.g., in Fig. 2, es is secondarily adjoined to reparieren while the second element of the tree set
is primarily added (substituted) to reparieren.

Obviously, all tree adjoining languages can be generated by RSN-MCTAGs since a TAG is
an MCTAG with unary multicomponent sets. It can be shown (see Kallmeyer, 2003) that fo
each RSN-MCTAGs of a speciﬁc type, equivalent LCFRSs (linear context-free rewriting sys-
tems, (Weir, 1988)) can be constructed. LCFRSs are mildly context-sensitive and in particular
polynomially parsable and therefore, this also holds for these speciﬁc RSN-MCTAGs. These
RSN-MCTAG perhaps cannot analyze all scrambling phenomena but, if the type is appropri-
ately chosen, they can analyze a sufﬁciently large set.

3 Scrambling

In many SOV languages, such as German, Hindi, Japanese and Korean, constituents (argument
or adjunct) display a larger freedom in term of ordering in clauses. This phenomenon is called
scrambling. (See (Uszkoreit, 1987) for a description of word order in German and (Lee, 1993)
for Korean.) The constituents of the lower clause can even occur in the upper clause, (so-called
long distance scrambling). E.g., the arguments es and jatongcha-lul of the embedded verb move
into the upper clause in German (1), repeated as (2)a., and in the Korean sentence (2)b.

(2) a.  dass cs1 der Mechaniker [ t1 zu reparieren ] Verspricht
b. jatongcha-lull keu-ka [ t1 surihakess-tako ] yaksokhaessta
the caracc hemm [ t1 repair-to ] promises
‘He promises to repair the car’

Generally, in both languages, there is no bound on the number of elements that can scramble in
one sentence, and there is no bound on the distance over which each element can scramble. In
the following we will show how RSN-MCTAG allows to deal with long distance scrambling.
Elementary trees for word order variations of (3) are shown in Fig. 3. We propose single trees
for non-scrambled elements, and tree sets for scrambled elements.

 that hemm the customerdm; the caracc to repair to try promises
‘... that he promises the customer to try to repair the car’

(4)  dass er das Auto1 dem Kunden  t1 zu reparieren ] zu Versuchen ] Verspricht

Consider (4) where the most deeply embedded NPW das Auto is scrambled into the upper
clause. For das Auto, the tree set is used. Further, we also use tree sets for the NPd,,,; dem Kunden
which intervenes between the scrambled argument and its clause, and for the VP clause repari-
eren of witch argument is scrambled out over a clause of depth 2 2. For the non-scrambled
NP,,0m er, and for the non-scrambled VP versuchen, single trees are used. Fig. 4 shows the
different derivation steps for (4). First, verspricht and versuchen are combined by substitution.
In the resulting derived tree (on the right on top of the ﬁgure), the bold VP node is now shared
by verspricht and versuchen. Then the auxiliary tree in the tree set for reparieren adjoins to the
shared node. This is a primary adjunction at versuchen. The initial tree is substituted for the VP
leaf of versuchen. The former root node of the reparieren auxiliary tree, i.e., the bold VP node
in the tree in the middle of the bottom of the ﬁgure, is now shared by verspricht, versuchen and
reparieren. The next secondary adjunctions can occur at this new shared node: dem Kunden is
added as sketched in the ﬁgure, and then das Auto is added in the same way. The tree for er is
added into the substitution slot in the verspricht tree.

In German, scrambling can never proceed out of tensed clauses. However in Korean, scrambling
out of a tensed clause is possible, e.g., in (5) the argument jatongcha-lul is scrambled out of a
tensed clause. This difference can be captured by using in Korean the node label S instead of
VP for the root and the foot node in the auxiliary trees for scrambling.3

3One aspect we did not consider in this paper but that deﬁ nitely needs to be spelled out is the fact that in both
languages, German and Korean, not all verbs allow scrambling to the same degree. In German, this is related to
the difference between obligatory and optionally coherent verbs (see (Meurers, 2000; Muller, 2002)). These facts
probably can be modelled using speciﬁ c features that control the scrambling possibilities of a Verb.

‘He said that the customer bought the car’

4 Extraposition

In German and Korean, clausal arguments can optionally appear behind the ﬁnite verb. This
is called extraposition. E.g., in (6), the reparieren VP occurs behind the ﬁnite verb verspricht.
The same goes for the Korean extraposition (7).

(6)  dass ermm dem Kundendat t1 Verspricht, [das Autoacc zu reparieren]1
‘... that he promises the customer to repair the car’

(7) keu-kamm kokaek-ekeydat t1 yaksokhassta, [jatongcha-lulacc surihakess -tako]1
‘He promises the customer to repair the car’

Extraposition is doubly unbounded, as it is the case for scrambling. In order to analyze extra-
position, we propose tree sets as the one for reparieren in Fig. 5. They resemble to those for
scrambling except that the foot node is on the left because the extraposed material goes to the
right of the ﬁnite verb. For the NP arguments in (6), we use the single trees shown in Fig. 3.
The derivation for (6) is as sketched in Fig. 5.

The following differences between German and Korean are observed: both languages allow
extraposition of complete VPs. Furthermore, in German, inﬁnitives without their arguments
can be extraposed (so-called third construction, see (8)a), which is not possible in Korean (see
(9)a). In Korean however, arguments of embedded verbs can be extraposed while leaving their
verb behind (see (9)b), which is not possible in German (see (8)b).4

(8) a.  dass er es t1 Verspricht, [zu reparieren]1
b.  dass er [ t1 zu reparieren ] Verspricht, [es ]1

(9) a. >I<keu-kamm jatongcha-lulacc t1 yaksokhassta, [surihakess-tako]1 b. keu-kanom [ t1
surihakess-tako ] yaksokhassta, [ jatongcha-lulacc ]1

To account for the difference between (8a) and (9a), we disallow the adjunction of scrambled
elements at the root nodes of Korean auxiliary extraposition trees.5 For (9b), in Korean, we
propose additional tree sets for extraposed NPs. They are similar to the tree sets for scrambled
NPs in Fig. 3, except that the foot node is on the left. Such tree sets do not exist in German.

4For this reason, Korean extraposition is often called rightforward scrambling.

5In German, even arguments of embedded VPs can be left behind as in  dass er [es] 1 verspricht, [[ t1 zu
reparieren] zu versuchen]. For such cases, we propose an additional VP node on the spine of extraposed inﬁ tives
where deeper embedded inﬁ nitives can be added. For reason of space, we will not go into the details here.

Kallmeyer, Yoon

5 Topicalization

Korean topicalization is realized with the topic marker -nun(-un). The topicalized constituent
has to appear in the beginning of clauses, e.g., jatongcha-nun in (10a.): an element marked
by -nun(-un) can also appear in sentence medial position e.g., jatongcha-nun in (10b.). It is
perceived, in Korean, that an element with -nun(-un) in sentence initial position receives the
theme reading, i.e., topicalization, and the counterpart in sentence medial position the con-
trastive reading. To describe topicalization movement, a topic argument may be inserted into
the verbal projection tree at [Spec, CP] (see for example (Suh, 2002)).

(10) a. jatongcha-nunl keu-ka [ t1 kuiphakess-tako ] yaksokhassta.
the cartop hemm [ t1 buy-to ] promises
‘As for the car, he promises to buy (it)’
b. keu-ka jatongcha-nun kuiphakess-tako yaksokhassta.
‘He promises to buy the car’

German topicalization is more strict. German exhibits the verb second effect (V2), i.e., the ﬁnite
verb (main verb or auxiliary) occupies the second position in the clause. This divides the clause
into two parts: the part before the ﬁnite verb, the Vorfeld (VF), and the part between the ﬁnite
verb and non-ﬁnite verb, the M ittlefeld (MF). The VF must contain exactly one constituent. This
constituent is considered having moved into the VF. This movement is called topicalization.
E.g., in (11) the auxiliary verb hat appears in second position, the NP.” das Buch that moved
from the MF into the ﬁrst position is topicalized.

(1 1) das B1.1Ch2 hat ihml niemand [ t1 t2 zu geben ] versucht.
the bookacc has himdat nobody [ t1 t2 to give] tried.
‘Nobody has tried to give him the book.’

In both languages, topicalization concerns exactly one element, and the element has to appear
in the beginning of the clause, while scrambling and extraposition can occur for more than one
element. I.e., no operation to add constituents in front of topicalized element is accepted. Fur-
thermore, in German matrix clauses, topicalization is obligatory. We capture these restrictions
by certain features. The last step in a derivation for a sentence exhibiting topicalization is the
adjunction of the topicalized constituent. The feature of the ﬁnal derived root node becomes
[ 8:  It prevents adding other constituents at the root.6

Topicalization and scrambling can occur simultaneously as in (11) where ihm is long-distance
scrambled and das Buch is long-distance topicalized. Fig. 6 shows the derivation for (11):
Starting with the initial tree for versucht, the auxiliary tree for geben is adjoined at the root
node with top category CP and bottom category VP (we assume here feature structures as labels
with different top and bottom features), and simultaneously the initial VP tree is added into the
lower VP. After this, the [ $11: ] root node is shared by versucht and geben. Then, niemand and
ihm are subsequently added. This gives the tree on the left of the bottom of the ﬁgure. Next,
hat is adjoined at the root which leads to a [ E1.) ] root node shared (among others) by geben and
versucht. Finally, the topicalized element is adjoined to the root node.

5We also pursued an alternative analysis, namely putting the slot for the topicalized element (a substitution
node) and the verb it depends on in the same initial tree. I.e., the topicalized element is added by substitution while
scrambled or extraposed elements are added by adjunction. This is a more obvious way to capture the restrictions
for topicalization. Unfortunately, this approach does not work with some combinations of topicalization and
scrambling as for example [es] 1 hat er [ t1 zu reparierenjg dem Kunden [ t2 zu versuchen] versprochen.

For topicalized elements in Korean, we propose the same kind of tree set as for German topi-
calized elements, except that the category of the foot node is unspeciﬁed. This does not ﬁx the
position of the top element between CP and C’(as in German).

6 Conclusion

Since TAG are not powerful enough to describe scrambling data in free word order languages,
alternative formalisms are needed. The proposals made so far in the litereature are not entirely
satisfying. Therefore, we developed a new TAG extension, restricted MCTAG with shared
nodes (RSN-MCTAG). The basic idea is that, after having performed an adjunction or substitu-
tion at some node, this node does not disappear (as in standard TAG) but instead, in the resulting
derived tree, the node is shared between the old tree and the newly added tree. Consequently,
further adjunctions at that node can be considered being adjunctions at either of the trees. In
combination with tree-local multicomponent derivation, this modiﬁcation of the TAG derivation
gives sufﬁcient additional power to analyse the difﬁcult scrambling data.

Considering data from German and Korean, we showed that RSN-MCTAG can adequately anal-
yse scrambling data, also in combination with extraposition and topicalization. The analyses
proposed in the paper treat long-distance scrambling, long-distance extraposition and long-
distance topicalization and they take into account the differences German and Korean exhibit
with respect to these phenomena.
