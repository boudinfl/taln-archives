<p>This paper describes a specific semantic property underlying binary dependencies: co-compo-
sition. We propose a more general definition than that given by Pustejovsky, what we call
&#8220;optional co-composition&#8221;. The aim of the paper is to explore the benefits of optional co-
composition in two disambiguation tasks: both word sense and structural disambiguation. Con-
cerning the second task, some experiments were performed on large corpora.</p>

<p>1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The objective of this paper is to describe the role of binary syntactic dependencies (i.e., &#8220;head-
dependent&#8221; relations) in two specific NLP tasks: both word and structural disambiguation. Our
work is mainly based on two assumptions: first, there are two semantic structures underlying a
dependency: one where the dependent word is semantically required by the head, and another
where the head word is semantically required by the dependent. Second, for some particular
tasks such as word disambiguation or syntactic attachment, we also assume that one of both
structures can be more discriminant. So, in order to select a word sense or a syntactic attach-
ment, the most discriminant structure will be retained, in particular, the one containing the least
ambiguous word. In special cases, for instance when the two related words are highly ambigu-
ous, both structures can be retained. We call this phenomenon optional co-composition
</p>
<p>The main contribution of this paper is to define some properties of optional co-composition
as well as how it is involved in two disambiguation tasks: word sense disambiguation and
attachment resolution (syntactic structure disambiguation).
</p>
<p>This paper is organized as follows. First, section 2 will introduce what we consider to be
the restrictive structure of a dependency. This structure will be defined on the basis of the
notion of optional co-composition. The description will be focused on a particular task: word
sense disambiguation. Finally, in section 3, we will focus on a different task: the acquisition
of selection restrictions from corpora, and the use of selection restrictions to solve structural
ambiguity. Some empirical results will be given.
</p>
<p>2 Optional Co-composition
</p>
<p>We assume that two words related by a syntactic dependency impose semantic restrictions on
each other. Not only verbs and adjectives may select different senses of nouns, but also nouns
must be taken as active selectors of senses of verbs, adjectives, and other nouns. We call this
property of dependencies &#8220;optional co-composition&#8221;.
</p>
<p>In (5), the co-composition operation is activated only in some specific binary dependencies. In
particular, it is triggered off if both the verb and the noun contain very specific lexical infor-
mation. In Generative Lexicon, the scope of this particular operation is then very narrow. We
consider, however, that co-composition is a general semantic property underlying any syntactic
dependency between two words. In this section, we will propose a more general notion of co-
composition than the one proposed by Pustejovsky. To do it, functional application will not be
driven by relational words such as verbs and adjectives, but by syntactic dependencies.
</p>
<p>We consider dependencies as active objects that control and regulate the selection requirements
imposed by the two related words. So, they are not taken here as merely passive syntactic cues
related in a particular way (linking rules, syntactic-semantic mappings, syntactic assignments,
etc.) to thematic roles or lexical entailments of verbs (1). They are conceived of as the main
functional operations taking part in the process of sense interpretation.
</p>
<p>On this basis, we associate functional application, not to relational expressions (verbs, adjec-
tives, . . . ), but to dependencies. In functional terms, a dependency can be defined as a binary
&#955;-expression:
</p>
<p>&#955;x&#955;y dep(x, y) (1)</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Disambiguation and Optional Co-Composition
</p>
<p>where x and y are variables for word meanings. The meaning of the head word, x, will be in the
first position, while the meaning of the dependent, y, will be in the second one. The different
types of dependency we consider are the following: nominal verb complement situated to the
left of the verb (lobj), or to the right of the verb (robj), prepositional complement of the verb
(iobj_prep &#8722; name), prepositional complement of the noun (prep &#8722; name), and attributive
function of the adjective (attr).
</p>
<p>The objective of this subsection is to show how dependencies can be used to disambiguate words
in a co-compositional way. Take the expression &#8220;drive the tunnel&#8221;. In WordNet, &#8220;drive&#8221; has 21
senses; one of them represents the event of making a passage by excavating. By contrast, &#8220;tun-
nel&#8221; merely has 2 very related senses. In order to interpret any composite expression, we argue
that the hearer/reader uses the least ambiguous word as disambiguator. In &#8220;drive the tunnel&#8221;, it
is the noun that selects for a specific verb sense: the making sense. The word disambiguation
strategy we propose here consists of the following 3 steps:
</p>
<p>1. Identifying a dependency function:
From the verb-noun expression, the robj binary function is proposed:
</p>
<p>&#955;x&#955;y robj(x, y) (2)
</p>
<p>2. Choice of a word disambiguator:
The dependency function is applied first to the word considered to be the best discriminator. By
default, it will be the word with the least number of senses, that is, the least polysemous word.
As has been said before, the chosen word must be &#8220;tunnel&#8221;. As a result, this word is assigned
to the dependent position of robj:
</p>
<p>[&#955;x&#955;y robj(x, y)] (tunnel)
</p>
<p>&#955;x robj(x, tunnel) (3)
</p>
<p>This is still a predicative function likely to be applied to the word in the head position. Conse-
quently, word &#8220;tunnel&#8221;, in the dependent position, is taken here as the active predicate.
3. Restrictions of the predicate and Final Application:
The selection restrictions imposed by &#8220;tunnel&#8221; in the robj dependency represent the classes of
verbs with which that noun can combine in this dependency. In the next section, we will out-
line how word classes can be learned from corpus data. The predicative function associated to
&#8220;tunnel&#8221; is applied to verb &#8220;drive&#8221;:
</p>
<p>[&#955;x robj(x, tunnel : &#963;)] (drive)
</p>
<p>robj(drive&#963;, tunnel) (4)
</p>
<p>The requirements imposed by the nominal predicate, and noted &#963;, allow to select a particular
sense of the verb if and only if, at least, one of the 21 senses of &#8220;drive&#8221; belongs to &#963;. drive&#963;
represents the particular sense of &#8220;drive&#8221; that is compatible with restrictions &#963;. Such a procedure
is independent of the way we represent (as features, word clusters, probabilities, etc.) word
senses and selection restrictions.
</p>
<p>This strategy is more efficient than the standard compositional approaches, since here the dis-
ambiguation process is controlled by the word that is considered to be the most appropriate to
discriminate the sense of the other one. Moreover, optional co-composition makes functional
application more flexible, since it allows to choose as predicative function whatever word within</p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Pablo Gamallo, Gabriel P. Lopes, Alexandre Agustini
</p>
<p>a dependency, or even, if necessary, both words. Any word of a binary dependency may become
the lexical function and, then, be used to disambiguate the meaning of the other word.
</p>
<p>Nevertheless, word disambiguation should not be restricted to a single binary dependency. The
target word is actually disambiguated by all words to which it is syntactically related. So, the
disambiguating context of a word is not only a single dependency, but also the set of dependen-
cies it participates in. This remains beyond the scope of the paper.
</p>
<p>We have described in this section the internal structure of syntactic dependencies and how they
can be used to disambiguate words in a flexible way. In the following section, we will see the
benefits of optional co-composition in a different task: syntactic disambiguation.
</p>
<p>3 Using Co-composition to Solve Syntactic Ambiguity
</p>
<p>This section describes a method to solve syntactic attachment. First, we acquire selection re-
strictions from corpora, then the acquired information is used to build a subcategorization lex-
icon. Finally, a specific heuristic is used to propose correct syntactic attachments. The main
characteristic of the method is the use of the assumption on optional co-composition introduced
in the previous section. This method has been accurately described in (2).
</p>
<p>3.1 Selection Restrictions Acquisition
</p>
<p>An experiment to automatically acquire selection restrictions was performed on Portuguese cor-
pora1. We used an unsupervised and knowledge-poor method. It is unsupervised because no
training corpora semantically labeled and corrected by hand is needed. It is knowledge-poor
since no handcrafted thesaurus such as WordNet nor no MRD is required (3). The method con-
sists of the following steps. First, raw text is automatically tagged and then analyzed in binary
syntactic dependencies using a simple heuristic based on Right Association. For instance, the
expression &#8220;the salary of the secretary&quot; gives rise to the relation:
</p>
<p>of(salary, secretary) (5)
</p>
<p>Then, following the assumption on co-composition, we extract two different functional predi-
cates from every binary dependency. From (5), we extract:
</p>
<p>&#955;y of(salary, y), &#955;x of(x, secretary) (6)
</p>
<p>Finally, we generate clusters of predicates by computing their word distribution. We assume,
in particular, that different predicates are considered to impose the same selection restrictions if
they have similar word distribution. Similarity is calculated by using a particular version of the
Lin coefficient (4). As a result, a predicate like &#955;y of(salary, y) may be aggregated into the
following cluster:
</p>
<p>&#955;y of(salary, y), &#955;y of(post, y), &#955;y lobj(resign, y), &#955;x attr(x, competent) (7)
</p>
<p>which is associated to those words co-occurring at least once with each predicate of the cluster,
e.g.:
</p>
<p>13 million words belonging to the P.G.R. (Portuguese General Attorney Opinions) corpora, which is constituted
by case-law documents. Due to space restrictions, we will give only English translations.</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Disambiguation and Optional Co-Composition
</p>
<p>secretary (secretary)
</p>
<p>&#183; &#955;x of(x, secretary) = (post, career, category, qualification, rank, status, function,
remuneration, job, salary)
&#183; &#955;y of(secretary, y) = (administration, assembly, authority, council direction, com-
pany, entity, state, government , institute, judge, minister, ministery, president, service, tri-
bunal organ)
&#183; &#955;x iobj_to(x, secretary) = (allude, apply, attend, assign, concern, correspond,
determine, resort, refer, relate)
&#183; &#955;x iobj_to(x, secretary) = (concern, be-incombent, concede, confer, trust, send,
be-incombent, belong)
&#183; &#955;x iobj_by(x, secretary) = (sign, concede, confer, homologate, compliment, sub-
scribe)
&#183; &#955;x lobj(x, secretary) = (define, establish, make, fix, indicate, foresee, refer)
</p>
<p>Table 1: Excerpt of lexicon entry secretary
</p>
<p>secretary, president, minister, manager, worker, journalist
</p>
<p>We use these words to extensionally define the selection restrictions imposed by the similar
predicates of cluster (7). In fact, the set of words required by similar predicates represents the
extensional description of their semantic preferences.
</p>
<p>3.2 Building a Subcategorization Lexicon
</p>
<p>The acquired clusters of predicates and their associated words are used to build a lexicon with
syntactic and semantic subcategorization information. Table 1 shows an excerpt of the informa-
tion learned concerning the entry secretary. This entry defines six different predicative struc-
tures. Notice that it is the notion of co-composition that allows us to define a great number of
predicates that are not usual in the standard approaches to subcategorization. Five of the six
predicates with secretary do not subcategorize standard dependent complements, but different
types of heads. This is a significant novelty of our approach.
</p>
<p>3.3 Attachment Heuristic
</p>
<p>Optional co-composition is also at the center of syntactic disambiguation. It underlies the
heuristic we use to check if two phrases are dependent or not. This heuristic states that two
phrases are syntactically attached only if one of these two conditions is verified: either the
dependent is semantically required by the head, or the head is semantically required by the
dependent. Take the expression:
</p>
<p>correspond to the secretary of the minister
</p>
<p>There exist at least three possible attachments: 1) correspond is attached to secretary by means
of preposition to; 2) correspond is attached to minister by means of preposition of ; 3) secretary
is attached to minister by means of preposition of. Each attachment is verified using the co-
compositional information stored in the lexicon. For instance, the first attachment is verified if</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Pablo Gamallo, Gabriel P. Lopes, Alexandre Agustini
</p>
<p>only if, at least, one of the two following conditions is satisfied:
Dependent Condition: predicate &#955;y iobj_to(correspond, y) subcategorizes a class of nouns
to which secretary belongs;
Head Condition: context &#955;x iobj_to(x, secretary) subcategorizes a class of verbs to which
correspond belongs.
According to the lexical information illustrated in Table 1, the attachment is allowed because the
Head Condition is satisfied by the verb. Note that, even if we had not learned information on the
verb restrictions, the attachment would be allowed since the restrictions imposed by one of the
two possible predicative structures (the nominal one) are satisfied. Following this attachment
procedure, we are able to decide that secretary and minister are dependent, but not correspond
and minister. An evaluation protocol is described in (2).
</p>
<p>4 Conclusion
</p>
<p>This paper has introduced a particular property of syntactic dependencies, namely optional co-
composition, and its role in the process of disambiguation. This property allows learning two
complementary semantic structures of a dependency, even if only one of them contains enough
information to select a word sense or a specific syntactic attachment. The theoretical back-
ground underlying many works on NLP is often far from most recent and innovative approaches
to lexical semantics, cognitive linguistics, or other linguistic areas. The main contribution of the
paper is to merge different theoretical approaches (generative lexicon and cognitive grammar)
in order to define a sound notion, optional co-compositionality, and describe how it can be used
in different NLP applications. In sum, our aim is to use some ideas taken from current linguistic
approaches to improve NLP applications.
