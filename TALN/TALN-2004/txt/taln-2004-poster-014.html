<p>R&#233;sum&#233; - Abstract
</p>
<p>De mani&#232;re g&#233;n&#233;rale, les linguistes informaticiens utilisent les structures de donn&#233;es arbores-
centes pour la documentation et l&#8217;analyse des donn&#233;es morphologiques et syntactiques. Dans
cet article nous appliquons de telles structures sur des donn&#233;es phonologiques et nous d&#233;mon-
trons comment de telles repr&#233;sentations peuvent avoir des applications utiles et pratiques en
lexicographie informatique. &#192; cet effet, nous d&#233;crivons trois modules int&#233;gr&#233;s: Le premier
module d&#233;finit un ensemble de caract&#233;ristiques multilangages dans une structure arborescente
exprim&#233;e en XML; le deuxi&#232;me module parcours cet arbre et &#233;tablis une g&#233;n&#233;ralisation sur
des donn&#233;es contenues dans cet arborescence, optimise les donn&#233;es phonologiques et mets en
valeur les implications des caract&#233;ristiques. Le troisi&#232;me module utilise l&#8217;information contenue
dans l&#8217;arborescence comme une base de connaissance pour la g&#233;n&#233;ration de syllabes lexiques &#224;
caract&#233;ristiques multiples.

<p>Tree-based data structures are commonly used by computational linguists for the documenta-
tion and analysis of morphological and syntactic data. In this paper we apply such structures
to phonological data and demonstrate how such representations can have practical and ben-
eficial applications in computational lexicography. To this end, we describe three integrated
modules: the first defines a multilingual feature set within a tree-based structure using XML;
the second module traverses this tree and generalises over the data contained within it, optimis-
ing the phonological data and highlighting feature implications. The third uses the information
contained within the tree representation as a knowledge base for the generation of multiple
feature-based syllable lexica.

<p>1 Introduction
</p>
<p>The lack of a standardised scheme for the annotation of phonological information is in sharp
contrast to other research areas within computational linguistics and natural language process-
ing where numerous schemes exist. A comprehensive collection of tools and formats for creat-
ing and managing linguistic annotations are provided online by the Linguistic Data Consortium.
We aim to aid research into standards of this kind by presenting a structured format for the en-
coding of phonological information. The principal motivation for our work was twofold: a. the
development and use of consistent and coherent encoding formats for data representation, as
well as standardised schemes for annotation of linguistic information and b. the development
of reusable, integrated systems and tool architectures for language processing and analysis, in-
cluding the corresponding development of a data architecture to best suit research needs (Ide,
1999).
Although the encoding format presented lends itself easily to use within a wide range of NLP
research fields, this paper focuses on its application in computational lexicography, specifically
to the generation of multiple phonological lexica. The Extensible Markup Language (XML) is
used frequently to model natural language data in large scale applications and is employed here
to define the structure of phonological feature trees (Neugebauer &amp; Wilson, 2004). The parsing
of a marked up document in order to retrieve the data contained within it is a common applica-
tion task to which the Document Object Model (DOM) is key as it defines a set of interfaces for
referring to, retrieving and changing items within an annotated structure. In the following sec-
tions, we outline the process that defines such phonological tree structures, describe the feature
optimisation module and explain how our lexical generation mechanism exploits the phonolog-
ical information contained within our encoding format to create multiple lexica from a single
foundation lexicon.
</p>
<p>2 Phonological Feature Trees - Acquisition
</p>
<p>Phonological feature trees are data structures that define a set of user specified symbol-to-
phonological feature attribute mappings. They are repositories of phonological information
explicitly linked to particular symbol sets. Their creation was driven by the need to have a
structured symbol-feature inventory that could be used as a knowledge source for phonological
document generation and mapping. The acquisition module described here, outlines how user-
driven definition of such repositories annotates and stores the data within a useful and coherent
data structure.
The acquisition module provides a graphical user environment for the annotation of these map-
pings and stores them in a structured XML-tree called a feature profile. Feature profiles are
multilingual resources as they are intended to define a full inventory of phonological feature
information for a complete symbol set across a number of languages. Thus, from an abstract
feature set, language-specific symbol-to-feature mappings are constructed.
The data structure described here not only encodes associations between symbols and one par-
ticular feature set, it is intended to annotate mappings between a symbol set and multiple fea-
ture sets. Thus phonological feature trees may model associations between &#8211; for example &#8211; the
SAMPA notation set and phonological features inspired by the IPA, binary features, and even
features from other modalities (e.g. mappings between symbols and visual features). It is this
ability to encode mappings across numerous feature sets that enables phonological feature trees</p>

</p>
<p>to act as the knowledge base for multiple lexicon generation.
Phonological feature trees as discussed in this paper form the second and third phases of the pro-
duction process shown in Figure 1. A finite-state automaton modelling the legal combinations
of sounds for a supplied domain &#8211; a phonotactic automaton &#8211; is partially learned (phase 1); this
structure is then used to automatically generate the interface for the feature definition module
(phase 2); once feature-to-symbol associations have been created in phase 2, the optimisation
phase generalises over the feature set, supplying additional information regarding logical rela-
tions among individual as well as sets of features (phase 3); finally the information contained
within the phonological feature trees is used by the lexical generation module (phase 4). As
indicated in the top box in Figure 1 we require linguistic annotation at least at the segment level
(depicted by &#8220;&#8805; segment level&#8221;).
</p>
<p>Figure 1: Production process
</p>
<p>A training set of syllables is input into a grammar induction tool to learn the structure of a de-
terministic stochastic automaton from a set of training sequences (Carson-Berndsen &amp; Kelly,
2004). A finite-state machine is induced which models all legal combination of sounds within
the syllable domain based on the training data. This finite-state machine serves as the segment-
annotated corpus in our example. The feature definition module takes this phonotactic au-
tomaton as its input and extracts every unique occurrence of a phonological symbol from the
automaton and dynamically creates a graphical user environment that allows the user to define
feature associations for those symbols. By automatically creating the interface, the module en-
sures that users define associations only for those symbols that occur in the data set.
The interfaces of the definition module provide for numerous means of feature annotation (e.g.
different arity of features).
From this data a Document Type Definition (DTD) is automatically generated. This DTD will
be used to provide top-down constraints in the creation of subsequent profiles that use the same
feature set. A section from a DTD describing a multi-valued feature profile is shown below,
where an attribute like manner might take values describing broad sound classes.

<p>Once the full feature set has been specified, the module generates a graphical representation of
the data set (Figure 3). Users then simply create associations by pointing and clicking, first at
the symbol and then at the features that are to be associated with it. Feature associations are
added to the feature profile upon user confirmation.</p>

<p>Figure 3: User Interface Generation (selection)
</p>
<p>The symbols used have an underlying IPA-Unicode representation, however a notation trans-
ducer within the module allows for the mapping between a number of notation conventions
(e.g. SAMPA, Wordbet, ARPAbet etc.). Any such mappings maintain the structural integrity
of the phonological feature tree, namely symbols are mapped to their corresponding cognates
as defined by the transducer, user defined feature associations are mapped to themselves. To
summarise, the module provides a number of graphical interfaces for the following procedures:
a. the graphical display of a phonological feature tree and all its nodes containing articula-
tory information as well as the language for which it is defined, b. graphical editing of the
information contained within the trees &#8211; addition and deletion of nodes/tiers, modification of
articulatory data. Any changes that have implications for DTDs (e.g. addition of an extra tier
of information) are implemented automatically and c. selection of particular functions for the
manipulation of the data contained within feature trees, e.g. the extraction of a language specific
profile from the superset of all feature associations.
Other interfaces include the notation transducer already mentioned and an interface to the lexical
generation mechanism described below. The following section describes how we can determine
generalisations about the information contained within a feature profile.
</p>
<p>3 Phonological Feature Trees - Generalisation
</p>
<p>The above motivations for defining phonological feature profiles lead to an expressive knowl-
edge base which provides a fine-grained level of description for the modelling of individual
phonological segments. However such a rich set of features, while having extensive descriptive
value, is not particularly suited to user-driven manipulation such as the identification of implica-
tional relations between (sets of) features. Our goal is to obtain this valuable information while
limiting the need for manual effort and to this end we propose a computational method based
on automated deduction which delivers correspondences between individual features as well as
all sets of sounds created by combinations of those. Annotated segement entries as defined by
phase two of the production process (Figure 1) represent the input for phase three as we seek to
automatically extract information about feature distribution within our database.
The optimisation module traverses the phonological feature tree, applying our algorithm with a
view to performing as much deterministic inference as possible. In this way, we automatically
generate feature hierarchies, similar to information hierarchies in unification-based grammar
formalisms, ordering features with respect to the size of their extents, i.e. the segment sets they
describe.1 This information enriches the phonological feature profiles with two elements that
</p>
<p>1The denotational semantics of XML do not provide for multiple inheritance, therefore, we choose to &quot;multiply
out&quot; every single combination of features to achieve its extent in terms of phonological segments.</p>

</p>
<p>distinguish between those features which imply other features and those which do not (Neuge-
bauer &amp; Wilson, 2004). If the symbol-to-feature mappings are manipulated, updates to our
knowledge base are carried out using XSL, the stylesheet language for transforming XML doc-
uments.
</p>
<p>4 Lexicon Generation
</p>
<p>The acquisition of the featural data stored in phonological feature trees as described above is an
incremental process. Over time, phonological information from a particular feature set is asso-
ciated with a complete set of symbols. Given a set of alternative features, instead of creating
a separate feature tree for that particular phonological data set, it seems a more efficient use of
the information to store them within a superstructure that models symbol-feature associations
over a number of feature sets. By explicitly linking symbols with a number of associations of
phonological features, we can facilitate the smooth mapping of symbols from one feature set
into another. It is this process that forms the basis for multiple lexicon generation.
Given linguistic documents that are based on specific phonological features, it may at times
prove useful to generate additional documents that are structurally identical to the originals but
that use phonological information from alternative feature sets. In doing so, speech scientists
can examine the suitability of various feature sets with respect to certain applications. An exam-
ple might be the suitability of different feature sets for parametric speech synthesis. In this sec-
tion, we outline how phonological feature trees can be used to generate multiple feature-based
lexica that are structural clones of each other but which source their phonological information
from different feature sets. The lexica that are discussed here are feature-based syllable lexica
represented in XML. The foundation lexicon is automatically created by LeXMLicon, a lexical
generation mechanism (Wilson et al., 2003). Lexica created by this mechanism not only model
the featural information for a segment, but also its position within the syllable. An example
entry is shown below.

</p>
<p>&lt;/segment&gt;&lt;/nucleus&gt;
&lt;/syllable&gt;
</p>
<p>Figure 4: Sample entry from foundation lexicon
</p>
<p>The feature set of the foundation lexicon is based on the sound descriptions provided in the IPA.
Similar phonological representations of lexical items have been proposed ((Tiberius &amp; Evans,
2000), (Cahill et al., 2000)), although in their work DATR is used to model the data. LeXM-
Licon, while using the inference mechanisms of DATR to construct a concise phonological
lexicon, uses XML to model the output data (Figure 4). By grouping a number of these fea-
ture trees into a super-tree that models feature associations from different phonological feature
sets with particular symbols, the syllable structures that contain those symbols can map easily
between feature sets.</p>

<p>5 Conclusion
</p>
<p>The generation of multiple lexica from one foundation lexicon makes use of two interacting
mechanisms: one for the creation of a foundation lexicon and another that oversees the mapping
of this foundation lexicon onto other additional lexica with different phonological information.
The output is an XML representation of the syllable, that models segmental units as well as
their syllabic position. This constitutes the foundation lexicon from which all others will be
generated. During the subsequent generation of additional lexica, all syllabic forms contained
within the foundation lexicon are mapped to identical structures in the new lexicon. However,
by using the feature tree as a knowledge source, we use previously defined feature associations
encoded within it to model the segmental entries within the new lexicon. In this way, multiple
lexica based on different feature sets can be created.
