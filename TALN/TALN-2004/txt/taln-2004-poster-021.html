<p>R&#233;sum&#233; - Abstract
</p>
<p>Les entit&#233;es nom&#233;es et plus g&#233;n&#233;ralement les multi-mots sont des ressources importantes pour
plusieurs applications. Cependant, les m&#233;todes d&#8217;extraction automatique, ind&#233;pendentes de la
langue, de multi-mots, ne nous donnent pas des donn&#233;es 100% fiables. Dans ce papier nous
proposons premi&#232;rement une m&#233;thode pour selectioner entit&#233;s nom&#233;es d&#8217;entre les multi-mots
extraits automatiquement et, deuxi&#232;mement, une m&#233;thode de groupement des entit&#233;s nom&#233;es
non-supervision&#233;e et ind&#233;pendente de la langue, en utilisant de la statistique. La deuxi&#232;me phase
de groupement rends l&#8217;&#233;valuation humaine plus simple. Les traits utilis&#233;s pour le groupement
sont d&#233;crits et motiv&#233;s. L&#8217;analyse faite pour le groupement nous a permis d&#8217;obtenir diff&#233;rents
groupes d&#8217;entit&#233;s nom&#233;es. La m&#233;thode a &#233;t&#233; appliqu&#233;e sur le bulgare et l&#8217;anglais. La pr&#233;cision
obtenue pour certains groupes a &#233;t&#233; tr&#232;s haute. D&#8217;autres groupes doivent &#234;tre encore rafin&#233;s.
Par ailleurs, les traits discrimants appris pendant la phase de groupement nous permettent de
classifier de nouvelles entit&#233;s nom&#233;es.

<p>Named entities and more generally Multiword Lexical Units (MWUs) are important for various
applications. However, language independent methods for automatically extracting MWUs do
not provide us with clean data. So, in this paper we propose a method for selecting possible
named entities from automatically extracted MWUs, and later, a statistics-based language in-
dependent unsupervised approach is applied to possible named entities in order to cluster them
according to their type. Statistical features used by our clustering process are described and
motivated. The Model-Based Clustering Analysis (MBCA) software enabled us to obtain dif-
ferent clusters for proposed named entities. The method was applied to Bulgarian and English.
For some clusters, precision is very high; other clusters still need further refinement. Based on
the obtained clusters, it is also possible to classify new possible named entities.</p>

</p>
<p>1 Introduction
</p>
<p>This paper aims at proposing a methodology for clustering named entities. A language indepen-
dent method is explained for extracting relevant multiword units (MWUs) (Silva et al., 1999)
in section 2. As it is shown in section 3, from these MWUs, possible named entities are filtered
using simple heuristics. Attributes used for clustering them are described in section 4. Cluster-
ing methodology and results are presented in section 5. A method for classifying new named
entities is shown in section 6, and related work and conclusions in section 7.
</p>
<p>2 Extracting MWUs from the Corpus
</p>
<p>Three tools working together, are used for extracting MWUs from any corpus: the LocalMaxs
algorithm, the Symmetric Conditional Probability (SCP) statistical measure and the Fair Dis-
persion Point Normalization (FDPN) (Silva et al., 1999). Thus, let us take an n-gram as a string
of n words in any text. So, isolated words are 1-grams and the string President of the Republic
is a 4-gram. One can intuitively accept that there is a strong cohesion within the 4-gram United
Nations General Assembly, but not in the 4-gram of that but not. LocalMaxs algorithm is based
on the idea that a MWU should be an n-gram whose cohesion is higher than any (n&#8722;1)-gram
contained in the n-gram; and should also be higher than the cohesion of all the (n+1)-grams
containing that n-gram. Thus, LocalMaxs needs to compare cohesions of n-grams having dif-
ferent sizes: (n+1), n and (n&#8722;1) and sharing all but one word in the borders, as we are interested
on sequential n-grams. However, for determining the cohesion of an n-gram, we need to trans-
form it into a pseudo-bigram. So, identical weight is given to every possible contiguous bigram
in the n-gram by calculating the arithmetic mean show in equation 1. This corresponds to the
FDPN concept applied to the SCP (.), and then, a new measure, SCP_f(.), is obtained (Silva
et al., 1999).
</p>
<p>SCP_f(w1 . . . wn) =
p(w1 . . . wn)
</p>
<p>2
</p>
<p>1
n&#8722;1
&#8721;n&#8722;1
</p>
<p>i=1 p(w1 . . . wi) . p(wi+1 . . . wn)
(1)
</p>
<p>where p(w1 . . . wj) is the probability of the n-gram w1 . . . wj in the corpus. So, SCP_f(.)
reflects the average cohesion between any two adjacent contiguous sub-n-gram of the original
n-gram.
</p>
<p>3 Filtering MWUs
</p>
<p>For testing our approach we used an English corpus with 10 506 267 words and a Bulgarian
corpus with 4 110 838 words. LocalMaxs extracted 207 088 MWUs from the first corpus and</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Extracting Named Entities. A Statistical Approach
</p>
<p>164 655 MWUs from the second. These MWUs include named entities among other multi-
words. After separating those MWUs whose first and last words start with a capital letter, the
number of MWUs decreased to 50 558 for English and 11 498 for Bulgarian. Since named en-
tities in this languages usually have no long non-capital words with low probability, a second
filter was applied by calculating the following value for each MWU:
</p>
<p>minPL(w1 . . . wn) = min
i
</p>
<p>(PL(wi)) where PL(wi) =
freq(wi)
</p>
<p>N&#215;length(wi) . (2)
</p>
<p>And freq(wi) is the frequency of the i-th non-capital word of the MWU in the corpus; N
stands for the corpus size we are working with, and length(wi) is the number of characters of
word wi. Then, MWUs having minPL(w1 . . . wn) greater than a threshold were taken as good
named entities, since they have no long non-capital words with medium or low probability. The
threshold found seemed to be the same for both languages: 0.0053 (Kozareva et al., 2004).
</p>
<p>4 Attributes
</p>
<p>Proper features were needed for clustering filtered named entities. As shown in (Kozareva et
al., 2004), the best features found were Permanency and PLStdDev.
</p>
<p>Permanency(w1 . . . wn) =
1
</p>
<p>n
</p>
<p>n&#8721;
i=1
</p>
<p>f(wi)
</p>
<p>f &#8727;(wi)
(3)
</p>
<p>where f(wi) is the frequency of the word wi in the corpus, while f &#8727;(wi) is the frequency of
the same word but taking all occurrences of case insensitive forms (ex: life, Life, LIFE). This
feature helps to distinguish names of persons (where Permanency is close to 1, as they occur
written the same way) from other types of named entities. The second attribute is based on the
standard deviation concept taking the probability and the length of words in the named entity.
</p>
<p>PLStdDev(w1. . .wn) =
&#8730;
</p>
<p>1
n
</p>
<p>&#8721;n
i=1(PL(wi)&#8722;PL(w))2 PL(w) = 1n
</p>
<p>&#8721;n
i=1 PL(wi) .
</p>
<p>(4)
Equation 2 gives PL(.). PLStdDev is useful for distinguishing named entities such as Re-
public of Bulgaria from others like Bulgarian Parliament. These named entities have different
variation on the probability and length of their words. Here, we present the standardization to
assign the same discriminant power to every attribute.
</p>
<p>zk,i =
xk,i&#8722;xk,&#183;
std(xk)
</p>
<p>xk,&#183; = 1l
&#8721;i=l
</p>
<p>i=1 xk,i std(xk) =
&#8730;
</p>
<p>1
l
</p>
<p>&#8721;l
i=1(xk,i &#8722; xk,&#183;)2 . (5)
</p>
<p>zk,i is the standardized value for the i-th element of the attribute k (xk,i); xk,. is the mean value
of the elements for the same attribute and l is the number of elements; std(xk) holds as the
standard deviation of the same set.
</p>
<p>5 Clustering Named Entities
</p>
<p>Then, having a matrix of named entities characterized by previous 2 features, clustering is done
using Model Based Clustering Analysis (MBCA) software. Different models are &#8220;simulated&#8221;
for the input matrix, and the most likely model is proposed by this approach. Due to limitations
imposed by the heavy clustering calculations done by MBCA, we clustered just a representative
1000 elements sample from the initial set of named entities for each corpus.</p>

<p>5.2 Discussion
</p>
<p>Clusters were proposed by MBCA considering VVV (Variable volume, Variable shape and
Variable orientation) the best model for both languages; details in (Fraley and Raftery, 1998).
This shows that clusters are not always spherical and have not the same volume. Person names
tend to have frozen writing, which is detected by Permanency attribute: cluster e3 for English
90% precision (table 1) and clusters b1 and b3 for Bugarian (100% precision). However, for</p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Extracting Named Entities. A Statistical Approach
</p>
<p>Bulgarian person names, those having no small and frequent words, that is, low PLStdDev
values, were put in cluster b1; those having high PLStdDev values are in cluster b3. So, for
person names, we have 1 cluster for English and 2 for Bulgarian. This is due to the very dif-
ferent nature of the corpora (Silva et al., 2004). Wrong written named entities are rare events
corresponding to low Permanency values: cluster e1 (97% precision) and cluster b2 (94% pre-
cision). The results of the other clusters require future work. They tend to have institutions and
city names: clusters e2, e4 and e5 with 22%, 29% and 50% precision respectively, and clusters
b4 and b5 with 25% and 49% precision. Precision and recall values were calculated on the basis
of majority of specific type of named entities clustered. So, if in the cluster of person names
occurred a name of an enterprise, this would count as failure.
</p>
<p>6 Classifying New Named Entities
</p>
<p>Although we have just clustered a representative sample of the initial set of named entities
the remaining elements must be also classified, concerning the clusters obtained. Beside that,
we must be able to classify new named entities that did not occur in our corpus. So, every
unclassified element must be part of any class represented by one of the already formed clusters,
or be clearly out of those clusters. During the process of classifying new named entities we used
the Discriminant Quadratic Score in order to indicate &#8220;how close&#8221; a named entity represented
by the vector &#1;y is to a class i.
</p>
<p>dQi (&#1;y) = &#8722;
1
</p>
<p>2
ln
&#8739;&#8739;&#8739;&#1;&#931;i
&#8739;&#8739;&#8739;&#8722; 1
</p>
<p>2
(&#1;y &#8722; &#1;&#181;i)T &#1;&#931;&#8722;1i (&#1;y &#8722; &#1;&#181;i) + ln pi . (6)
</p>
<p>Covariance matrix &#1;&#931;i is associated with the attributes that characterize the elements from the
class i, and it is estimated by the covariance matrix taking the elements (named entities) of clus-
ter i (see details on (Silva et al., 2004)). For Discriminant Quadratic Score, the most important
factor is the Mahalanobis Distance between the named entity &#1;y and the vector of means of class
i, (&#1;&#181;i), represented by the vector of means of cluster i (&#1;ci) (see details on (Silva et al., 2004)).
This lower this factor is, the higher the Quadratic Score. So, let &#1;y be a vector that represents
an element to be classified, and &#960;r a class represented by cluster r that contains named entities
(vectors &#1;e1, &#1;e2, . . . , &#1;en). Then &#1;y belongs to class &#960;r if and only if
</p>
<p>dQr (&#1;y) = max
i
</p>
<p>dQi (&#1;y) &#8743; dQr (&#1;y) &#8805; min
j
</p>
<p>dQr (&#1;ej) (7)
</p>
<p>where i = 1, 2, . . . , g; g is the number of classes (clusters), and j = 1, 2, . . . , n, where n is the
number of named entities of the cluster. Equation (7) describes a criterion for classifying new
named entities. This corresponds to the Minimum Total Probability of Misclassification Rule
for Normal Populations criterion, but with an extra condition we added: dQr (&#1;y) &#8805; min
</p>
<p>j
dQr (&#1;ej).
</p>
<p>This condition sets that an element &#1;y belongs to class r if its Quadratic score is also higher
or equal than the Quadratic Score of all elements of cluster r. This prevents a very &#8220;distant&#8221;
and &#8220;strange&#8221; element to be classified as a member of any class represented by the clusters. A
detailed explanation about the components of the vector &#1;y, representing the new named entity,
is given in (Silva et al., 2004). Although we have done just a few tests on classification, for
Bulgarian named entities this classifier showed 100% precision for person names and 60% for
institution names and city names. Similar values were obtained for English.</p>

<p>7 Related Work, Conclusions and Future Work
</p>
<p>Recently, some Machine Learning approaches such as (McNamee and Mayfield, 2002) have
been used to extract named entities. However, these systems usually require a set of labeled
data to be trained on, and this may not be available or be expensive to obtain. Other systems are
language oriented such as (Carreras et al., 2003), or symbolic dependent such as (Poibeau et
al., 2003). This paper points to an unsupervised statistics-based and language independent ap-
proach for clustering named entities. Firstly, thousands of MWUs were extracted from corpora
using LocalMaxs algorithm. Possible named entities were filtered and clustered using just two
attributes. This methodology was applied on 2 different corpora (English and Bulgarian) and
similar results were obtained in both languages for some clusters. The best number of clusters
was automatically calculated by Model-Based Cluster Analysis. The results are encouraging,
since about 95% of the person names and misspelled expressions were correctly grouped. How-
ever, there are problems to solve: it is not possible to distinguish S&#227;o Paulo as a person name
and S&#227;o Paulo as a location name, unless we use semantic information and look at the neigh-
bourhood of the MWU S&#227;o Paulo in the corpus. Besides, Permanency attribute does not work
if the language is not alphabetic or if it does not use upper-case for person names. So future
work has to be done, concerning other attributes and other kind of informations.
