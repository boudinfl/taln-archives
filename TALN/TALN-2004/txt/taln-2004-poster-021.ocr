Résumé - Abstract

Les entitées nomées et plus généralement les multi—mots sont des ressources importantes pour
plusieurs applications. Cependant, les métodes d’extraction automatique, indépendentes de la
langue, de multi—mots, ne nous donnent pas des données 100% ﬁables. Dans ce papier nous
proposons premiérement une méthode pour selectioner entités nomées d’entre les multi—mots
extraits automatiquement et, deuxiémement, une méthode de groupement des entités nomées
non—supervisionée et indépendente de la langue, en utilisant de la statistique. La deuxieme phase
de groupement rends l’évaluation humaine plus simple. Les traits utilisés pour le groupement
sont décrits et motivés. L’analyse faite pour le groupement nous a permis d’obtenir différents
groupes d’entite’s nomées. La méthode a été appliquée sur le bulgare et l’anglais. La précision
obtenue pour certains groupes a été trés haute. D’autres groupes doivent étre encore raﬁnés.
Par ailleurs, les traits discrimants appris pendant la phase de groupement nous permettent de
classiﬁer de nouvelles entités nomées.

Named entities and more generally Multiword Lexical Units (MWUS) are important for various
applications. However, language independent methods for automatically extracting MWUS do
not provide us with clean data. So, in this paper we propose a method for selecting possible
named entities from automatically extracted MWUS, and later, a statistics—based language in-
dependent unsupervised approach is applied to possible named entities in order to cluster them
according to their type. Statistical features used by our clustering process are described and
motivated. The Model—Based Clustering Analysis (MBCA) software enabled us to obtain dif-
ferent clusters for proposed named entities. The method was applied to Bulgarian and English.
For some clusters, precision is very high; other clusters still need further reﬁnement. Based on
the obtained clusters, it is also possible to classify new possible named entities.

1 Introduction

This paper aims at proposing a methodology for clustering named entities. A language indepen-
dent method is explained for extracting relevant multiword units (MWUS) (Silva et al., 1999)
in section 2. As it is shown in section 3, from these MWUS, possible named entities are ﬁltered
using simple heuristics. Attributes used for clustering them are described in section 4. Cluster-
ing methodology and results are presented in section 5. A method for classifying new named
entities is shown in section 6, and related work and conclusions in section 7.

2 Extracting MWUS from the Corpus

Three tools working together, are used for extracting MWUS from any corpus: the LocalMaxs
algorithm, the Symmetric Conditional Probability (SCP) statistical measure and the Fair Dis-
persion Point Normalization (FDPN) (Silva et al., 1999). Thus, let us take an n—gram as a string
of n words in any text. So, isolated words are 1—grams and the string President of the Republic
is a 4- gram. One can intuitively accept that there is a strong cohesion within the 4- gram United
Nations General Assembly, but not in the 4- gram of that but not. LocalMaxs algorithm is based
on the idea that a MWU should be an n— gram whose cohesion is higher than any (n— 1)— gram
contained in the n—gram; and should also be higher than the cohesion of all the (n+ 1)—grams
containing that n—gram. Thus, LocalMaxs needs to compare cohesions of n—grams having dif-
ferent sizes: (n+1), n and (n—1) and sharing all but one word in the borders, as we are interested
on sequential n— grams. However, for determining the cohesion of an n— gram, we need to trans-
form it into a pseudo—bi gram. So, identical weight is given to every possible contiguous bi gram
in the n—gram by calculating the arithmetic mean show in equation 1. This corresponds to the
FDPN concept applied to the S'C'P(.), and then, a new measure, S'C'P_f is obtained (Silva
et al., 1999).

p(w1 . . .wn)2

ﬁ Z:Z."=_11p(w1. . .w,-) .p(w,-+1...wn)

S'C'P_f(w1...wn) = (1)

where p(w1...wj) is the probability of the n—gram w1...wj in the corpus. So, S'C'P_f(.)
reﬂects the average cohesion between any two adjacent contiguous sub—n—gram of the original
n—gram.

3 Filtering MWUS

For testing our approach we used an English corpus with 10 506 267 words and a Bulgarian
corpus with 4 110 838 words. LocalMaxs extracted 207 088 MWUS from the ﬁrst corpus and

Extracting Named Entities. A Statistical Approach

164 655 MWUs from the second. These MWUs include named entities among other multi-
words. After separating those MWUs whose ﬁrst and last words start with a capital letter, the
number of MWUs decreased to 50 558 for English and 11 498 for Bulgarian. Since named en-
tities in this languages usually have no long non—capital words with low probability, a second
ﬁlter was applied by calculating the following value for each MWU:

minPL(w1 . . .wn) = mZ_in(PL(w,-)) where PL(w,-) =  @ . (2)

And freq(w,-) is the frequency of the i—th non—capital word of the MWU in the corpus; N
stands for the corpus size we are working with, and length(w,-) is the number of characters of
word w,-. Then, MWUs having minPL(w1 . . .wn) greater than a threshold were taken as good
named entities, since they have no long non—capital words with medium or low probability. The
threshold found seemed to be the same for both languages: 0.0053 (Kozareva et al., 2004).

4 Attributes

Proper features were needed for clustering ﬁltered named entities. As shown in (Kozareva et
al., 2004), the best features found were Permanency and PLS'tdDev.

f (Uh)
f*(wz')
where f is the frequency of the word w,- in the corpus, while f *(w,-) is the frequency of
the same word but taking all occurrences of case insensitive forms (ex: life, Life, LIFE). This
feature helps to distinguish names of persons (where Permanency is close to 1, as they occur

written the same way) from other types of named entities. The second attribute is based on the
standard deviation concept taking the probability and the length of words in the named entity.

1 W
Permanencg/(wl . . .wn) = — Z (3)
n
i=1

PLS'tdDev(w1. . .wn) = \/%Z:Z."=1(PL(w,-)—PL(w))2 PL(w) = %Z:Z."=1 PL(w,-) .

(4)
Equation 2 gives PL(.). PLS'tdDev is useful for distinguishing named entities such as Re-
public of Bulgaria from others like Bulgarian Parliament. These named entities have different
variation on the probability and length of their words. Here, we present the standardization to
assign the same discriminant power to every attribute.

Zlc,i =  90k,- =  $k,z' 3td(90Ic) = V  — $Ic,-)2 - (5)

2,6,, is the standardized value for the i—th element of the attribute I: (aim); ask? is the mean value
of the elements for the same attribute and l is the number of elements; std(ack) holds as the
standard deviation of the same set.

5 Clustering Named Entities

Then, having a matrix of named entities characterized by previous 2 features, clustering is done
using Model Based Clustering Analysis (MBCA) software. Different models are “simulated”
for the input matrix, and the most likely model is proposed by this approach. Due to limitations
imposed by the heavy clustering calculations done by MB CA, we clustered just a representative
1000 elements sample from the initial set of named entities for each corpus.

PORT CREDITS.

Cluster e2: Media Markets, Management Committee, White Cement Committee.

Cluster e3: Vega Cueva, Herrenbuck Herrenstuck Hex, Glatzen Harstell.

Cluster e4: Health and Social Services, Northern Ireland Oﬁice Crown, Bayer France and
Bayer Spain.

Cluster e5: Department of Tourism and Transport, Republic of Trinidad and Tobago, Secretary-
General of the United Nations.

natowa.

Cluster b2: MINERALNA WODA OT WODOIZTOCHNIK TK—I (MINERAL WATER FROM
WATER TANK TK—I), ZAKANATA S PRESTAPLENIE TRIABWA DA SE RAZGRANICHAWA
(THREATENING WIIH CRIME SHOULD BE DISTINGUISHED), DYRJAVWVA SOBSTWENOST
(STATE PROPERTY).

Cluster b3: Emil Georgiew Mihow i Walentin Minchew (Emil Georgiew Mihow and Walentin
Minche), Boris i Stefan Hadjiew, Konstantin Petrow Mochikow i Kiril Iwanow Okow.

(Ugyrchin and Iablanica).

Cluster b5: Sweta Nedelia, Dolno Kozarewo, Georgi Todorow Jilow.

5.2 Discussion

Clusters were proposed by MBCA considering VVV (Variable Volume, Variable shape and
Variable orientation) the best model for both languages; details in (Fraley and Raftery, 1998).
This shows that clusters are not always spherical and have not the same Volume. Person names
tend to have frozen writing, which is detected by Permanency attribute: cluster e3 for English
90% precision (table 1) and clusters b1 and b3 for Bugarian (100% precision). However, for

Extracting Named Entities. A Statistical Approach

Bulgarian person names, those having no small and frequent words, that is, low PLS'tdDe2)
values, were put in cluster bl; those having high PLS'tdDe2) values are in cluster b3. So, for
person names, we have 1 cluster for English and 2 for Bulgarian. This is due to the very dif-
ferent nature of the corpora (Silva et al., 2004). Wrong written named entities are rare events
corresponding to low Permanency values: cluster e1 (97% precision) and cluster b2 (94% pre-
cision). The results of the other clusters require future work. They tend to have institutions and
city names: clusters e2, e4 and e5 with 22%, 29% and 50% precision respectively, and clusters
b4 and b5 with 25% and 49% precision. Precision and recall values were calculated on the basis
of majority of speciﬁc type of named entities clustered. So, if in the cluster of person names
occurred a name of an enterprise, this would count as failure.

6 Classifying New Named Entities

Although we have just clustered a representative sample of the initial set of named entities
the remaining elements must be also classiﬁed, concerning the clusters obtained. Beside that,
we must be able to classify new named entities that did not occur in our corpus. So, every
unclassiﬁed element must be part of any class represented by one of the already formed clusters,
or be clearly out of those clusters. During the process of classifying new named entities we used
the Discriminant Quadratic Score in order to indicate “how close” a named entity represented
by the vector gjis to a class 2.

d?<y> = —§1n\2.- A §<y —u.->T2.-1<y —u.-> +1np.- . <6)

Covariance matrix  is associated with the attributes that characterize the elements from the
class 2, and it is estimated by the covariance matrix taking the elements (named entities) of clus-
ter 2 (see details on (Silva et al., 2004)). For Discriminant Quadratic Score, the most important
factor is the Mahalanobis Distance between the named entity 3]’ and the vector of means of class
2, ([2',-), represented by the vector of means of cluster 2 (6,7) (see details on (Silva et al., 2004)).
This lower this factor is, the higher the Quadratic Score. So, let 3]’ be a vector that represents
an element to be classiﬁed, and 7r, a class represented by cluster 7' that contains named entities

(vectors 1%}, E2, . . . , En). Then gfbelongs to class 7r, if and only if
d9(z7) = mgx am) A d9(37) 2 mjin d?<é,-> <7)
where 2 = 1, 2, . . . ,g; g is the number of classes (clusters), andj = 1, 2, . . . ,n, where n is the

number of named entities of the cluster. Equation (7) describes a criterion for classifying new

named entities. This corresponds to the Minimum Total Probability of Misclassiﬁcation Rule

for Normal Populations criterion, but with an extra condition we added: d9  2 min d9 
J

This condition sets that an element 3]’ belongs to class 7' if its Quadratic score is also higher
or equal than the Quadratic Score of all elements of cluster 7'. This prevents a very “distant”
and “strange” element to be classiﬁed as a member of any class represented by the clusters. A
detailed explanation about the components of the vector 3]’, representing the new named entity,
is given in (Silva et al., 2004). Although we have done just a few tests on classiﬁcation, for
Bulgarian named entities this classiﬁer showed 100% precision for person names and 60% for
institution names and city names. Similar values were obtained for English.

7 Related Work, Conclusions and Future Work

Recently, some Machine Learning approaches such as (McNamee and Mayﬁeld, 2002) have
been used to extract named entities. However, these systems usually require a set of labeled
data to be trained on, and this may not be available or be expensive to obtain. Other systems are
language oriented such as (Carreras et al., 2003), or symbolic dependent such as (Poibeau et
al., 2003). This paper points to an unsupervised statistics-based and language independent ap-
proach for clustering named entities. Firstly, thousands of MWUS were extracted from corpora
using LocalMaxs algorithm. Possible named entities were ﬁltered and clustered using just two
attributes. This methodology was applied on 2 different corpora (English and Bulgarian) and
similar results were obtained in both languages for some clusters. The best number of clusters
was automatically calculated by Model—Based Cluster Analysis. The results are encouraging,
since about 95% of the person names and misspelled expressions were correctly grouped. How-
ever, there are problems to solve: it is not possible to distinguish Sa'o Paulo as a person name
and Sa'o Paulo as a location name, unless we use semantic information and look at the neigh-
bourhood of the MWU Sa'o Paulo in the corpus. Besides, Permanency attribute does not work
if the language is not alphabetic or if it does not use upper-case for person names. So future
work has to be done, concerning other attributes and other kind of informations.
