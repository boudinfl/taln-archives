Résumé Dans cet article, nous avons examiné la relation entre pause et ponctuation (virgule,
point et virgule, deux-points). Toutes ces pauses sont internes aux phrases. À l'aide de l'analyse de
plusieurs milliers de pauses dans un corpus de presque 17 heures d'enregistrement réalisé par une
locutrice professionnelle native du portugais brésilien, nous avons vérifié une proportion
importante des pauses hors ponctuations (61,3%). Les données renforcent aussi la présence des
structures topique/commentaire dans la lecture à haute voix. Les résultats des durées de pause
correspondantes aux ponctuations sont consistants avec les données présentées dans les
grammaires.
Abstract In this paper we assess pause effects corresponding to comma, semicolon, colon and
the ones that are not related to any punctuation marks, all of them within sentences. Thus, through
the analysis of a corpus of approximately 17 hours of recording, carried out by a female
professional speaker (native) of the Brazilian Portuguese language, we observe a large proportion
of pauses without punctuation (61.3%). Besides, our data reinforce the presence of topic-comment
structures in reading. The results here presented with respect to pause and punctuation are
consistent with several studies about this theme.
1  Introduction
Several research work about pause (Vannier et al., 1999; Marin et al., 2002; Campione &
Véronis, 2002) have shown the existence of an inaccurate concept about the relationship between
pause and punctuation. This concept states that there exists a one-to-one relationship between
pause and punctuation; that is, if there is a pause there exists punctuation, no pause, no
punctuation. Other works also have shown that several structures, which seem inadequate in
reading, reflect usual situations of the spoken language, such as the topic-comment structures
(Cagliari, 1992; Pontes, 1987).
The aim of this study is to evaluate situations in which a Brazilian Portuguese speaker inserts
pauses in read speech. For such we analyze a Brazilian Portuguese speech corpus and also
Izabel C. Seara, Fernando S. Pacheco, Rui Seara Jr., Sandra Kafka, Rui Seara, Simone Klein
investigate the relationship between pause and punctuation marks. The used material consists of
recorded read texts by a female professional speaker. This paper is organized as follows. Section
2 presents our speech material and the analysis methodology. Section 3 shows how grammar
books have considered a relationship between pause and punctuation. Experimental analyses are
carried out in Section 4, investigating the occurrence of pauses, its duration, and the association
pause-punctuation. Finally, conclusions and remarks are presented in Section 5.
2 Corpus and Methodology
In the open literature we have found some research works about pause dynamics in natural
language which include: (a) a large number of small speech corpora (considering different
speakers), according to Campione & Véronis (2002); or (b) a large corpus of a single speaker,
according to Marin et al. (2002); Vannier et al. (1999). By considering that our goal is to obtain a
pause model for a Brazilian Portuguese speech synthesis system, we believe that the investigation
allowing for a single speaker not only could give rise to the required model, but also to determine
some important characteristics (concerning pauses) for the language in question. In this way, we
have based our research on a speech corpus with approximately 17 hours of recording,
accomplished by a female professional speaker (native) of the Brazilian Portuguese language.
This speaker read aloud texts at a normal speaking rate. The data were recorded in a studio and
care was taken to avoid environmental noise. The recorded corpus includes different kinds of text,
taken from newspapers and magazines, reports, extract of contemporaneous novels, short tales,
and academic texts all transcribed and labeled in terms of its morphosyntactic classification. For
this task we have used an ad hoc parser conceived for a speech synthesis system (Seara et al.,
2002). After that, an expert linguist corrected manually the labeling.
Our analysis is restricted to pauses associated with silent intervals. We have not considered filled
pauses (related to hesitations) and pauses created by the lengthening of phonetic segments. To
investigate the occurrence, position, and duration of pauses we have considered two main classes:
pauses with a silent interval larger than 300 ms, termed long pauses, and pauses with a silent
interval between 90 and 299 ms, named short pauses. Seara (2000) has shown that silent intervals
associated with the stop closure interval have an average duration of 45 ms for the Brazilian
Portuguese language. In this way, if we consider a lower limit equal to 90 ms, it is possible to
assure that there will always be a silent interval associated with a pause, even if the stop closure
occurs within this interval.
In order to study the duration and types of acoustic pauses, the speech data have been processed
automatically by a pause detector. This detector retrieves each context with pauses from the
corpus. In this way, we obtain a total of 9,985 pauses from the 17 hours of recording of which
3,858 are associated with punctuation marks. From those, 3,633 are accompanying commas; 52,
semicolon; and 173, colon. The other 6,127 pauses are not related to punctuation marks.
3 Pause and Punctuation Relationship in Grammar Books
Usually, Brazilian Portuguese teachers complain about mistakes associated with punctuation
made by their students. Such mistakes refer to the idea that it is imperative to observe the pauses
to assign a comma within a sentence. Thus, we perceive how difficult it is to teach the students
that the punctuation marks are based on syntactic structures of the sentences and not on the
carried out pauses.
Pauses and punctuation marks in Brazilian Portuguese read speech
If we observe Brazilian Portuguese grammar books, almost all of them mention pauses when they
discuss punctuation marks (Almeida, 1988; Faraco & Moura, 1991, among others). Grammarians
state that punctuation marks, such as comma, period, and semicolon are used for pause marking.
They also explain that the comma, period, and semicolon represent, respectively, pauses of short,
long and intermediate duration. However, they emphasize that the comma should not be used
either between the subject and verb or between the verb and object. Thus, we can assume that
pauses would not occur in reading aloud in these situations, since the punctuation marks, which
indicate such pauses, would not be included. Nevertheless, our speaker inserts pauses in these
structures. The following example presents pauses between verb-object and subject-verb,
respectively:
Os pesquisadores afirmam [short pause] que os resultados são a primeira evidência
de que os transgênicos [long pause] podem gerar conseqüências
(The researchers affirm [short pause] that the results are the first evidence that the
transgenic organisms [long pause] may produce consequences.)
Almeida (1988) states that a comma is never found where no pause is placed. Despite our analysis
data we have found 1% of commas with no correspondence to pauses. Thus, it would be more
accurate to state that frequently if there is no pause there is no punctuation. Remark that
Vannier et al. (1999) also have found 4.6% of pauses without punctuation in a French corpus.
To obtain a notion of the insertion dynamics of long and short pauses, mainly for the cases in
which there is no association with punctuation marks, we achieve an analysis of the syntactic
sequences previously mentioned.
4 Data Analysis and Discussion
To evaluate pauses between both subject-predicate and verb-object (structures in which the
comma is forbidden), we divide the data that present such sequences into two groups: subject and
verb (or predicate) termed Group 1, and verb and object, Group 2. Results are shown in Tables 1
and 2.
Table 1: Number and occurrence frequency of the Group 1 sequences with and without pauses

Group 1 Number of

Subject-verb 1658 51.88 459/1538 29.84 1079/1538 70.16
1538 (48.12%)
According to Tables 1 and 2, we can verify that there exists a larger tendency of occurring pauses
between subject and predicate than between verb and object. However, in both cases the
prohibition of the grammar books of inserting punctuation in these sequences has not inhibited the
presence of long pauses, albeit less frequent than short pauses. Besides the pauses observed in
Groups 1 and 2, we also verify that the pauses that are not associated with punctuation precede
syntactic boundaries (29.23% correspond to conjunctions, 17.48% prepositions, and 4.13%
adverbs). In these cases 81.22% are short pauses.

Examining the data that present pause between subject and verb, we notice that they seem to be
associated with topic-comment structures. However, Cagliari (1992) points out that in written
texts topic-comment structures should contain comma. As in the written texts there is no comma,
we expect that in reading aloud the topic-comment structure has not occurred. In such a structure
the speaker divides the statement into two tonal groups. A pause could (or not) be placed between
a tonal group and another. Our speaker reinforces such a structure, since her reading presents the
two tonal groups and pauses.
Topic-comment structure is a characteristic inherent to the spoken language. In Brazil the
spontaneous speech presents a large quantity and diversity of clauses with topic-comment
structures (Pontes, 1987). Nevertheless, as the grammar disapproves such structures, they do not
appear widely in written language, as occurs in spontaneous speech.
Our data show the presence of topic-comment structures in the text reading, since we notice that
48.12% of the subject-verb sequences are interrupted by pauses. On the other hand, the large
tendency of short pauses (70.16%) between subject and verb shows that in a certain way in
reading, the grammatical objection inhibits the presence of long pauses. Thus, based on the results
here shown we can verify the presence of topic-comment structures in reading, ratifying the data
obtained by other authors (Pontes, 1987; Cagliari, 1992; Mollica, 1993).
In Campione & Véronis (2002) a multilingual study about pauses in read speech and its
relationship with punctuation is presented. They show that 11.9% of pauses are not associated
with punctuation in the French language. The largest percentage of this kind of occurrence is
found in the Italian language, in which 33% of pauses are not associated with punctuation.
However, Vanier (1999 apud Campione & Véronis, 2002) presents a study about the same theme,
in which 36% of pauses are not associated with punctuation in the French language. Our data
seems to indicate that Brazilian Portuguese is the language that presents a larger occurrence of
pauses not associated with punctuation (61.36%), and in general the results have shown that
pauses that are not related to punctuation marks are mostly short pauses (see Fig. 1 and Table 3).
The pauses related to punctuation marks (whose plots are also shown in Fig. 1) include: (a) when
concerning commas, there is a slight tendency for them to be short; (b) when referring to
semicolons and colons there is a strong tendency to be long (with semicolon presenting an
intermediate duration) (see Table 3). However, we have not observed distinct clusters in our data,
since overlapping occurs between these three classes. The total average duration of the pauses
analyzed within the sentences is 224 ms. Data that present punctuation marks which do not
correspond to a pause are few (less than 1%).
Data related to the topic-comment structures in the written text do not present continuity violation.
This fact means that the speaker produces entire constituents without interrupting them, as
described in Strangert (2004). These pauses are inserted before syntactic boundaries. However, in
the reading it is possible to perceive a few cases of boundaries in syntactically unmotivated
positions. We have found in our corpus less than 1% of cases involving pauses without syntactic
Pauses and punctuation marks in Brazilian Portuguese read speech
motivation. This occurrence shows the continuity violation defined by Strangert (2004), as can be
verified in the following example:
... dentre outros [short pause] agentes de doenças. (...among other [short pause] disease agents.)
In this example, the pronoun outros and the noun agentes form a syntactic constituent (noun
phrase), which is interrupted by a short pause, representing a continuity violation.

5 Conclusions and Remarks
In this paper we have discussed the relationship between pauses and punctuation in the Brazilian
Portuguese language. We have shown that the claim where there is pause there is also punctuation
is not accurate, since we notice a large proportion of pauses without punctuation (61.3%). Also
the categorical claim where there is no pause there is no punctuation is not quite accurate, because
in 1% of the cases punctuation without pause has occurred. In addition, our data reinforce the
presence of topic-comment structures in reading. This fact was not expected due to the objection
to that structure. The results here presented with respect to pause and punctuation are consistent
with several studies about this theme. However, other analyses using more speakers of Brazilian
Portuguese are needed for obtaining a generalization of these findings as inherent to such a
language.
