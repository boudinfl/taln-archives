<p>The Mitkov algorithm for anaphora resolution in Portuguese 
</p>
<p>Abstract This paper reports on the use of the Mitkov&#180;s algorithm for pronoun resolution 
in texts written in Brazilian Portuguese. Third person pronouns are the only ones focused 
upon here, with noun phrases as antecedents. A system for anaphora resolution in Brazilian 
Portuguese texts was built that embeds most of the Mitkov&#8217;s features. Some of his resolution 
factors were directly incorporated into the system; others had to be slightly modified for 
language adequacy. The resulting approach was intrinsically evaluated on hand-annotated 
corpora. It was also compared to Lappin &amp; Leass&#8217;s algorithm for pronoun resolution, also 
customized to Portuguese. Success rate was the evaluation measure used in both experiments. 
The results of both evaluations are discussed here. 
</p>
<p>Keywords: Pronoun resolution, anaphora resolution.

<p>1 Introduction 
A major problem in Natural Language Processing (NLP) is to recognize or build text 
segments that convey coherent information. Amongst the linguistic devices for that, 
referential cohesion is one of the most significant ones for acknowledging, and guaranteeing, 
coherence. In this paper we address such a phenomenon in the interpretation scenario: we aim 
at identifying cohesive mechanisms that help automatically resolving referential links. 
Anaphoricity is the only linguistic construction under focus here, and so is pronoun resolution 
(PR). An anaphoric pronoun signals a relationship between two or more text components that 
share with each other their meanings. When anaphoric, it comes after its antecedent referent 
in the text, which is usually a noun phrase (NP). An example follows1: 
</p>
<p>(1) O parlamentari, por&#233;m, &#233; alvo de acusa&#231;&#227;o em outro esc&#226;ndalo. Elei ser&#225; investigado 
sobre as den&#250;ncias de corrup&#231;&#227;o (...). 
[The member of the parliament]i, however, is enrolled as guilty in other scandal. Hei will 
be investigated on the corruption accusations (&#8230;). 
</p>
<p>Above, the pronoun Ele (He) is an anaphor whose antecedent is the NP O parlamentar (The 
member of the parliament). This conveys, thus, a full meaning, whilst the pronoun itself is 
issued the NP meaning. Differently from this, other types of anaphors also may be used, e.g., 
the generalization introduced by the NP &#8216;the corruption accusations&#8217;. This type of anaphor 
involves ontological associations and other referential links (e.g., &#8216;other scandal&#8217; enables the 
plural &#8216;accusations&#8217;). Usually, ontological referential links do not entail the same meaning, 
but similar meanings that make them connect to each other. Contrarily, anaphoric pronouns 
convey no meaning, but their antecedent ones. So, to resolve the anaphoric Ele above, 
retrieving the former NP is of utmost importance.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Mitkov algorithm for anaphora resolution in Portuguese 
</p>
<p>PR may be very complex when there are many antecedent candidates. To resolve that, varied 
linguistic features may be needed, involving morphologic, syntactic, semantic, or pragmatic 
processing. In this line, several computational approaches have been undertaken for English 
or Spanish. Examples of the former are those by (Hobbs, 1978), (Lappin &amp; Leass, 1994), 
(Mitkov, 1998), and (Bergsma &amp; Lin, 2006); an example of the latter is the work by (Palomar 
et al., 2001). There are few approaches to Brazilian Portuguese (BP), namely, modified 
versions of Lappin &amp; Leass&#8217; algorithm (Coelho, 2005) and Hobbs&#8217; model (Santos &amp; 
Carvalho, 2007), and another that uses heterogeneous knowledge for PR (Paraboni, 1997).  
</p>
<p>We adopted Mitkov&#8217;s model for the following reasons: (1) it has been explored for several 
languages and it has proved to be both language-independent and portable; (2) it is heuristics-
based and does not depend upon deep knowledge. Instead, it applies surface or empirical 
information to determine candidate antecedents of an anaphor. It also adopts usual parsing 
and morphological preprocessing tools, which are largely available for most languages 
currently explored in NLP, and so they are for BP. In our implementation, Mitkov&#8217;s original 
algorithm has been modified to handle only 3rd person pronouns that convey NPs as 
antecedents. An antecedent NP may be in the very same sentence as the anaphor (intra-
sentential PR) or in a different sentence (inter-sentential PR). 
</p>
<p>Mitkov introduces the so-called anaphora resolution factors, which are of two types. 
Restrictive factors signal properties that must be presented by the antecedent candidates, in 
order for them to resolve the anaphor. Those candidates that do not present such properties 
are thus discarded. Oppositely, preferential factors do not discard candidates; just classify 
them according to their likelihood of resolving the anaphor the best. Usually, the latter factors 
are applied in conjunction with the former: classification takes place only after filtering those 
potential candidates through factors that are restrictive. The highest the probability of a 
candidate, the more likely it is to be indicated as the antecedent of the anaphor under focus. 
</p>
<p>In what follows, we first present Mitkov&#8217;s proposal for anaphora resolution (Section 2), then 
we introduce our approach for PR in BP (Section 3). In Section 4 we describe our PR 
assessment. Final remarks are presented in Section 5.  
</p>
<p>2 The Mitkov&#8217;s algorithm  
In pursuing a knowledge-poor approach, Mitkov avoids complex syntactic and semantic 
constructions by adopting a set of heuristics &#8211; the antecedent indicators &#8211; that are capable of 
pinpointing potential antecedents of an anaphor based on surface indicators. First, the text 
under focus is preprocessed through parsing and extracting NPs. Then, the following steps 
take place: (1) at most two previous sentences to the anaphor are examined, as the referential 
context for its antecedent NP. The result is a set of NPs. (2) to narrow the number of 
candidate NPs, gender and number concordance with the anaphor is verified and potential 
NPs are excluded, resulting in a smaller candidate set, or the set of potential antecedents. (3) 
Each potential NP is thus scored for the likelihood of being the antecedent of the anaphor. 
First, each antecedent indicator allows issuing the NP an integer value ranging from -1 to 2. 
Then such values are summed up for the final NP score. The highest scored NP in the set of 
potential candidates is finally chosen as the antecedent. In a tie case, the closest candidate to 
the anaphor is chosen instead.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>3 Adapting Mitkov&#8217;s algorithm for PR in Brazilian Portuguese 
In adapting Mitkov&#8217;s algorithm for BP, we named our system RAPM, for Resolu&#231;&#227;o 
Anaf&#243;rica do Portugu&#234;s baseada no algoritmo de Mitkov (Anaphora Resolution for 
Portuguese based on Mitkov&#8217;s algorithm). RAPM differs from the original algorithm in that it 
has been specifically drawn to BP. Also, and most importantly, its input texts are only 
automatically annotated, which is not the case in Mitkov&#8217;s approach, because its 
morphosyntactic annotations are manually corrected before going into anaphora resolution 
itself. A third distinction concerns the way preprocessing is undertaken in RAPM: currently it 
has not yet been integrated in RAPM, for practical reasons, as we shall describe in Section 4. 
Finally, to resolve morphological dependencies RAPM looks up an XML file that conveys 
correct information on gender and number of proper nouns and the antecedent search scope is 
of three sentences, instead of two. The XML file includes every proper noun found in the 
input corpus of texts and aims at minimizing pre-processing problems: in the absence of such 
information, they would be assigned both genders and numbers. 
</p>
<p>RAPM proceeds, thus, in the following way: it identifies the NPs that appear previously to the 
pronouns using the three-sentence window, then it produces the set of potential NP candidates 
in the same way as Mitkov&#8217;s model does. As already mentioned, antecedent indicators may 
endorse or prevent an NP candidate of being the antecedent of a pronoun. In the former case, 
the sum total is positive; in the latter, it is negative. Only five out of eleven antecedent 
indicators by Mitkov were incorporated into RAPM, along with three others that we found 
interesting to add, as follows the last three are the novel ones: 
</p>
<p>First NP (FNP). A +1 score is issued to the first NP of each sentence. This heuristic may be 
either justified on syntactic, or on communication terms, in that human beings usually express 
meanings through distinct language levels. According to Mitkov, for example, in declarative 
sentences the FNP occupies the subject position. In the absence of a parse tree, theories of 
both communication and discourse organization might help determining which should be such 
FNP, provided that they signaled the underlying communicative or discourse structure of the 
focused text. If Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995) were considered, e.g., the FNP would 
be the actual center of the sentence. Conversely, if (Ventura &amp; Lima-Lopes, 2002) or (Firbas, 
1992) were used, the corresponding given-new or thematic-rhematic information should 
signal that. In either case, given-new or theme-rheme units could provide coreferential links 
as do a first NP and a pronoun, at the text surface. It is worthwhile to notice that, since 
declarative sentences convey a default discourse organization, the theme/given unit can be the 
very NP occupying the subject position, as pinpointed before.  
</p>
<p>Lexical Reiteration (LR). A +2 score is issued to NPs that occur twice or more within the 
search scope; a +1 score is issued to an NP otherwise. LR assumes that a greater score signals 
NPs that are more salient and, thus, more likely to be the anaphor antecedent than those that 
score less. In RAPM reiterated lexical items are identified through direct string matching. 
</p>
<p>Indefinite NP (INP). Indefinite NPs are assigned a -1 score because very often they are 
supposed to be less likely to be antecedents of pronominal anaphors than definite ones 
(Mitkov, 1997). RAPM regards an NP as definite if its nucleus is modified by a definite 
article or by demonstrative or possessive pronouns. 
</p>
<p>Prepositional NP (PNP). A -1 score is issued to those NPs that occur in a prepositional 
phrase. Such a demoting score may be justified by the Centering Theory (Grosz et al., 1995): 
the sentence main constituents are classified according to their salience (e.g., subject, direct, 
and indirect objects in this decreasing salience order) and the most salient units provide the </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Mitkov algorithm for anaphora resolution in Portuguese 
</p>
<p>center of a text segment. Moreover, a sentence center is more likely to be a candidate 
antecedent of an anaphor than an NP occurring in a prepositional phrase sentences. 
</p>
<p>Referential Distance (RD). This antecedent indicator may promote or demote a candidate 
according to its distance from the anaphor: NPs in the immediate antecedent clause, in the 
very same sentence as the anaphor, are scored +2; NPs in the previous sentence are scored +1; 
NPs in a sentence that is two sentences apart from that of the anaphor are scored 0; NPs still 
farther than those are scored -1. 
</p>
<p>Syntactic Parallelism (SP). A +1 score is issued to an NP that conveys the same syntactic 
function as the corresponding anaphor. 
</p>
<p>Nearest NP (NNP). A positive +1 score is issued to the nearest NP to the anaphor. This 
indicator is used as a baseline by Mitkov, and so it is in RAPM, in which case it corresponds 
to the so-called &#8216;Baseline_NP&#8217;2. 
</p>
<p>Proper Noun (PN). Proper nouns are scored +1 in RAPM because they occurred with 
relative frequency as anaphors antecedents in our corpus. The assumption behind such a score 
was that promoting PNs could improve PR performance. 
</p>
<p>Using the above antecedent indicators to resolve pronouns in BP aims only at predicting the 
language behavior concerning PR, and not at constraining automatic PR to them. For this 
reason, Mitkov called them preference factors: they are not intended to be definite, but 
deductible. Although such indicators may punctuate anaphor antecedents incorrectly, usually 
PR is improved when they are used altogether, as we shall show when we apply them to BP, 
in Section 4. 
</p>
<p>Adding the indicators SP, NNP, and PN to RAPM resulted from a corpus analysis that aimed 
at filtering out those Mitkov&#8217;s antecedent factors that didn&#8217;t apply to BP. Thus, they were 
chosen for the following reasons: (a) since the input texts to RAPM are already 
morphosyntactically annotated, syntactic parallelism (SP) could be readily verified; (b) a 
nearest NP (NNP) to the anaphoric pronoun tended to be its antecedent; (c) proper nouns 
(PN) were highly frequent in the corpus as anaphor antecedents. So, using them should be 
advantageous for PR in RAPM. 
</p>
<p>Excluding the remaining six Mitkov&#8217;s indicators from RAPM was due to their inadequacy to 
the corpus under focus in our work. For example, the original indicator &#8216;Section heading 
preference&#8217; did not apply to our corpus, which conveys only non-structured or non-titled 
texts. Amongst RAPM eight indicators, two are restrictive (INP and PNP) and one (RD) may 
be either restrictive our preferential, for its possibility of assigning negative or positive values 
to a candidate. The remaining indicators are preferential. As illustration of the RAPM 
processing, consider the journalistic text segment (2).

</p>
<p>4 Assessing RAPM 
We adopted the success rate measure (Mitkov, 2002) to assess RAPM. It is defined as the 
ratio between the total number of correctly resolved anaphors and the total number of 
anaphors that are present in the whole corpus of texts. Having the input texts previously 
annotated for anaphors by human experts was, thus, of utmost importance here: such a corpus 
is a reference corpus. 
</p>
<p>According to Mitkov, the success rate should mirror exactly the performance of the anaphora 
resolver itself, with no interference of any problem resulting from preprocessing. He 
emphasizes that the real success rate of a system may only be achieved if the input data are 
correct. So, he corrects by hand any possible annotation of the input texts that have been 
wrongly morphosyntactically tagged, as previously mentioned. However reasonable his 
arguments may be, although the current version of RAPM does not have an integrated 
preprocessing module (both working in pipeline instead), we consider such pre-editing 
unrealistic. So, we did not apply any correction procedure to our input data, aiming at a more 
realistic black box approach in the future. More importantly, we already consider PR to be 
fully automated, as if we had just plain texts as input. A possible drawback of this is that 
miss-annotated data may contribute negatively to the PR performance, as we shall discuss 
below.

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>The Mitkov algorithm for anaphora resolution in Portuguese 
</p>
<p>In assessing RAPM, we used three corpora of distinct genres &#8211; the ones also adopted by 
(Coelho, 2005): a law, a literary, and a newswire one. The law corpus is composed of 16 
Portuguese Attorney General documents (c.a. 110,610 words; 260 3rd person pronominal 
anaphors) and most texts convey long and complex sentences. The literary corpus, also 
conveying complex sentences, consists of the whole book &#8216;O alienista&#8217;, by the Brazilian 
author Machado de Assis (c.a. 16,530 words; 573 3rd person pronominal anaphors). The 
newswire corpus is composed by 14 texts of the Veja magazine (c.a. 13,217 words; 222 3rd 
person anaphoric pronouns) and it conveys simpler sentences than the others.  
</p>
<p>Our comparison with Coelho&#8217;s approach (Coelho, 2005) was due to the lack of 
comprehensive assessments on BP for anaphora resolution: his was the only one that used 
success rate as the evaluation measure in a more comprehensive way and, apart from the law 
corpus, his corpora aimed at a general readership, oppositely to the others, which were more 
domain-dependent, such as (Paraboni, 1997). The extra gain in adopting his corpora was that 
we did not have to preprocess our data, since Coelho had it all done. We even did not have to 
re-run Coelho&#8217;s system: we entirely reproduced his experimental setting. This allowed us 
decide to keep preprocessing apart from RAPM. Actually, we just used the files that were 
formerly automatically annotated by Coelho as input to RAPM. His tags provide 
morphosyntactic information resulting from the PALAVRAS parser (Bick, 2000) and co-
referential annotation. This has been manually carried out with the support of the MMAX tool 
(M&#252;ller &amp; Strube, 2001). Additionally, the Xtractor tool (Gasperin et al., 2003) was used to 
convert the output by PALAVRAS in XML files. 
</p>
<p>RAPM assessment consisted of comparing the file of each text of the reference corpus with 
the corresponding file generated automatically by the system. This file, also in XML, contains 
all the tags that identify both anaphoric pronouns and their corresponding antecedents. 
Figures 1 and 2 depict a record of each file concerning example (1) given in Section 1. For 
assessment purposes, an anaphor is considered correctly resolved either if the automatic 
solution is identical to the manual one or if it is an NP that is the nucleus or part of the 
nucleus of the NP manually annotated. Acknowledging either case has been manual.

</p>
<p>Aiming at a broad assessment, we derived several versions of RAPM by combining the 
antecedent indicators in an ad-hoc manner. The resulting indicator sets varied in size and 
were configured amongst those that seemed to be most promising for PR in BP. Hereafter, 
each version is identified by &#8220;RAPM_n&#8221;, n signaling the amount of antecedent indicators </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>considered. Overall, eight distinct versions were provided, as follows (IS stands for the 
Indicators Set considered): 
</p>
<p>&#8226; RAPM_2: IS = {INP, RD} 
&#8226; RAPM_3: IS = {INP, PNP, RD} 
&#8226; RAPM_4: IS = {INP, PNP, RD, NNP} 
&#8226; RAPM_5: IS = {FNP, LR, INP, PNP, RD} 
&#8226; RAPM_6_SP: IS = {FNP, LR, INP, PNP, RD, SP} 
&#8226; RAPM_6_NNP: IS = {FNP, LR, INP, PNP, RD, NNP} 
&#8226; RAPM_6_PN: IS = {FNP, LR, INP, PNP, RD, PN} 
&#8226; RAPM_8: IS = {FNP, LR, INP, PNP, RD, SP, NNP, PN} 
</p>
<p>Combining indicators as in the above versions was merely based upon a previous corpus 
analysis to find out which, amongst all Mitkov&#8217;s factors, would fit RAPM. The analysis 
consisted of comparing automatically generated sums for the potential sets of antecedent 
candidates with reference annotations. Initially, the indicators with the most promising 
correction scores were combined, yielding the first 3 versions of RAPM. Those indicators 
were INP, RD, PNP, and NNP classified INP&gt;NNP&gt;RD&gt;PNP (X&gt;Y indicating X score 
greater than Y score). Differently from these and RAPM_8, which conveys all the indicators, 
RAPM_5 considers only those also managed by Mitkov. Each of the 3 RAPM_6 versions was 
built adding to the RAPM_5 set each new indicator we introduced, one at a time. 
</p>
<p>RAPM assessment was undertaken in three different ways: firstly, we measured the average 
success rate of each system depicted above, when running on the newswire corpus (Table 2). 
The strategy with the best success rate (RAPM_8) was then used in two other experiments: 
we compared its performance with the results by (Coelho, 2005) (Table 3) and finally we 
used again RAPM_8 results on the newswire corpus, but to compare it with two distinct 
baselines, namely, &#8216;Baseline-NP&#8217; and &#8216;Baseline_Subj&#8217; (Table 4). In this last case, we used the 
same baselines as did Mitkov in (Mitkov, 2002). Baseline-NP pinpoints as the antecedent the 
closest NP to the pronoun, provided that the NP agrees in gender and number with the 
pronoun. Baseline_Subj adds to the Baseline-NP a third constraint: the antecedent NP must 
occupy the subject position in the sentence it occurs. The results of each assessment follow, in 
a decreasing success rate order.

</p>
<p>As shows Table 2, RAPM_8 was the system that had the best average success rate (67%). So, 
it was the only system used in the other two experiments. Although RAPM_8 performed 
better in the overall assessment, its use may be questionable because the system that was 
classified the second, RAPM_3, presented a close success rate (66%) using much fewer 
antecedent indicators. This result suggests that using impeditive indicators, i.e., INP and PNP, 
may well help resolving pronouns in BP, when newswire texts are considered, and is less 
costly. Even RAPM_6_NNP, which reached the 3rd best av. success rate, also performs 
closely to RAPM_8, and demands less indicators. Comparing the 3 versions RAPM_6, adding 
NNP to the original 5 indicators seems to be the only one that may slightly improve the 
success rate. Still, it does improve on RAPM_5 in 4 perceptual points. Comparing now the 
success rates of our eight systems with those by Coelho, ours were consistently superior: 
43,56% by Coelho, against our worst case for RAPM_6_SP (60,26%), for the newswire 
corpus. If we consider only RAPM_8, the outperforming is even more expressive: for the 
same corpus, RAPM_8 scored an average of 67,01% success rate. Even for the other corpora 
RAPM_8 expressively beat Coelho&#8217;s system. The third comparison, between RAPM_8 and 
the two baselines, also confirms RAPM_8 superiority. 
</p>
<p>5 Final Remarks 
Given the results presented above, it is clear that adapting Mitkov&#8217;s algorithm for pronoun 
resolution in Brazilian Portuguese is promising, even having it modified for suitability due to 
language differences. Actually, our RAPM_8 version conveys not only the 5 indicators 
inherited from that approach, but the ones we introduced. This may be a novel and 
contributing feature for resolving anaphoric pronouns in BP.  Moreover, having 8 distinct 
versions of RAPM shows that any of the proposed combinations considerably outperforms 
the baseline procedures, when dealing with BP. All our systems are even more suitable than 
the one based on Lappin &amp; Leass model, at least in what concerns the corpora explored here. 
Most importantly, our assessment was quite comprehensive, if we consider the varied 
combinations of antecedent indicators. 
</p>
<p>Concerning the original approach by Mitkov (89,7% av. success rate), we could crudely say 
that RAPM_8 still has a significant room for improvement. However, it is important to notice 
that achieving that high rate has been possible because human expertise and hard man-work 
has been provided to feed the system with correct input data. This contrasts very deeply with </p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>our strategy, which aims at getting bare texts and resolving its pronominal anaphors entirely 
automatically. RAPM_8 performance is even more understandable when we notice that there 
was an expressive noise introduced by automatic morphosyntactic annotation. The main 
errors generated in that phase included wrong morphological annotations of both NPs and 
pronouns, which generated information that was certainly crucial for the low success rate for 
PR. During the pronoun resolution itself, an expressive problem was that of accusing pronoun 
antecedents that were not NPs. RAPM was not tailored to deal with such cases, even when 
such antecedents were correct. So, it is very likely that overcoming such obstacles will 
improve RAPM performance. A deeper evaluation of the impact of the errors presented by 
RAPM_8 as a result of pre-processing shall be carried out in that direction. Also, verifying 
the adequacy of the values assigned to each case and each antecedent indicator is relevant. 
However, this is not straightforward to accomplish, for it involves scaling up the same 
method of linguistic analysis that we carried out, which was entirely dependent upon human 
expertise. It also involves considering other corpus-based means to verify the indicators 
adequacy. Moreover, having RAPM_8, which conveys all the antecedent indicators 
considered, as the best system for PR in BP, does not entitle us to say that RAPM_8 will work 
well when other data are used. There are many other ways of exploring further the present 
results, including verifying which combination of the values the indicators can assign to an 
NP would be more profitable. Aiming at this seems quite reasonable, since our approach is 
entirely empirical. However, it is not less complex: we could have too many combinations of 
values and features to investigate. So, considering other, statistical methods to pinpoint a 
more reliable feature combination should be also applicable. 
</p>
<p>In tuning the system, we could also consider other features, such as other syntactic filters, c-
command constraints (Reinhart, 1983), or even the use of the Center Theory. Finally, we 
could also carry out a previous hand-editing of the input data, as did Mitkov, to certify that 
the input to our explored RAPM versions would not be significantly responsible for the PR 
problems. In such a case, we should solve first the preprocessing problems and turn back to 
reengineering the system. Overall, RAPM may be useful for several NLP applications, 
including Automatic Summarization and Information Retrieval, which are the ones focused 
more closely in our research. By resolving anaphoric pronouns, automatically generated 
summaries may be more cohesive and, thus, more coherent. Using heuristics especially driven 
to deal with BP phenomena will certainly bring about interesting contributions to such 
applications.
