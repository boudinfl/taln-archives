<p>Abstract In this paper, we present a new approach to disambiguation Arabic using a joint 
rule-based model which is conceptualized using Dependency Grammar. This approach helps 
in highly accurate analysis of sentences. The analysis produces a semantic net like structure 
expressed by means of Universal Networking Language (UNL) - a recently proposed 
interlingua. Extremely varied and complex phenomena of Arabic language have been 
addressed.

<p>1 Introduction 
The Arabic grammarians (1200 years ago, Iraq) recognized government and syntactic 
dependency structure. Many researchers believe that the theoretical framework of ancient 
Arabic grammar and more specifically its theory of case assignment (nazariyyat al&#8217;amal), can 
be considered a dependency grammar(Owens 1988; Kruijff 2002). 
Dependency grammar (DG) is a class of syntactic theories developed by Lucien Tesni&#232;re. It is 
distinct from phrase structure grammars, as it lacks phrasal nodes. Structure is determined by 
the relation between a word (a head) and its dependents. Dependency grammars are not 
defined by a specific word order, and are thus well suited to languages with free word order, 
such as Arabic. Specifically, Arabic reveals strong interaction between morphological and 
syntactic processing, which challenges the validity of NLP models that are based on different 
phases (layers). The available Arabic rule-based systems use the pipeline model (where 
morphology is performed first and syntactic processing follows) for processing and 
disambiguation. It is obvious that this approach is not adequate for Arabic. On the other hand, 
one would not expect statistical techniques to perform well on infixing languages like Arabic.  
</p>
<p>We will take a different approach from previous work. Our system is a rule-based one, which 
is conceptualized by using dependency grammar, in which linguistic structure is described in 
terms of dependency relations among the words of a sentence; it does so without resorting to 
units of analysis smaller or larger than the word. Although dependency grammar has its roots </p>

</p>
<p>to the work of early Arabic Grammarians, all of the existing (rule-based) Arabic processing 
systems are built on phrase structure theory. Processing text using phrase structure framework 
may suit languages like English, but not a nearly free order language like Arabic (Mel&#8217;tchuk 
1988; Covington 1992). 
</p>
<p>We suggest performing morphological and syntactic processing of Arabic text in a single and 
joint framework; thereby facilitating the disambiguation process. We will first discuss the 
sources of ambiguity in Arabic. Then, we discuss methods of disambiguation based on the 
dependency grammar and the necessity of having an integrated model. Finally, we present the 
architecture and implementation of our system. 
</p>
<p>2 Properties of Arabic Language 
Compared to French or English, Arabic is an agglutinative and highly inflected language 
shows its proper types of difficulties in morphological disambiguation, since a large number 
of its ambiguities come from both the stemming and the categorization of a morpheme while 
most of ambiguities in French or English are related to the categorization of a morpheme only. 
Phrases and sentences in Arabic have a relatively free word. The same grammatical relations 
can have different syntactic structures. Thus, morphological information is crucial in 
providing signs for structural dependencies. Arabic sentences are characterized by a strong 
tendency for agreement between its constituents, between verb and noun, noun and adjective, 
in matters of numbers, gender, definitiveness, case, person etc. These properties are expressed 
by a comprehensive system of affixation. 
</p>
<p>Ambiguities are mainly caused by the dropping of the short vowels. Thus, a word can have 
different meanings. In Arabic there are three categories of words: noun, verbs and particles. 
The dropping of short vowels can cause ambiguities within the same category or across 
different categories. For example, the word &#1;&#2;&#3; [qbl]   has the following interpretations (from 
Buckwaltel Arabic morphological analyser): 
INPUT STRING: &#1;&#2;&#3; 
LOOK-UP WORD: qbl 
  SOLUTION 1: (qabola) [qabola_1] qabola/PREP 
     (GLOSS):  + before +  
  SOLUTION 2: (qaboli) [qabola_1] qaboli/PREP 
     (GLOSS):  + before +  
  SOLUTION 3: (qabolu) [qabolu_1] qabolu/ADV 
     (GLOSS):  + before/prior +  
  SOLUTION 4: (qibal) [qibal_1] qibal/NOUN 
     (GLOSS):  + (on the) part of +  
  SOLUTION 5: (qabila) [qabil-a_1] qabil/VERB_PERFECT+a/PVSUFF_SUBJ:3MS 
     (GLOSS):  + accept/receive/approve + he/it &lt;verb&gt; 
  SOLUTION 6: (qab~ala) [qab~al_1] qab~al/VERB_PERFECT+a/PVSUFF_SUBJ:3MS 
     (GLOSS):  + kiss + he/it &lt;verb&gt; 
 
</p>
<p>Additionally, Arabic uses a diverse system of prefixes, suffixes, and pronouns that are 
attached to the words, creating compound forms that further complicate text manipulation. 
Identifying such particles is crucial for analyzing syntactic structures as they reveal structural 
dependencies such as subordinate clauses, adjuncts, and prepositional phrase attachments. 
This means that there are multiple ways in which a word can be categorized or broken down 
to its constituent morphemes. For instance, the word &#1579;&#1585;&#1575;&#7;&#1570; can be segmented differently as 
presented in table 1: </p>

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Arabic Disambiguation Using Dependency Grammar 
</p>
<p>catastrophes/tragedies Noun (broken plural) 
Like/such as + inheritor ka/PREP+wAriv/noun 
</p>
<p>Table 1: Ambiguity caused by compound forms 
</p>
<p>On other cases, correct morphological analysis is required to resolve structural ambiguities 
among Arabic sentence. For example, consider the first sentence in table 2, the &#8220;&#9;&#10;&#8221; suffix 
attached to &#8220;&#11;&#12;&#1608;&#8221; provides information about number (dual) and case ending (accusative). The 
accusative sign determines the syntactic roles of each constituents of the first sentence 
although it is in the basic order VSO. In the second sentence, the same suffix disambiguate the 
syntactic roles despite that the object precedes the subject.  In the third sentence, the verb hit 
&#8220;&#14;&#1576;&#16;&#17;&#8221; follows the two boys &#8220;&#1606;&#1575;&#11;&#12;&#7;&#12;&#1575;&#8221; and there is a number agreement between both of them. 
Additionally, the two boys &#8220;&#1606;&#1575;&#11;&#12;&#7;&#12;&#1575;&#8221; takes the nominative sign and hani &#8220;&#14;&#19;&#20;&#14;&#1607;&#8221; takes the 
accusative sign suggesting that:  Hani is the object and the two boys are the subject.

</p>

</p>
<p>Table 2: Examples of structural ambiguities 
</p>
<p>These examples show that there is a circular dependency between   syntactic processing and 
morphological analysis. The segmentation and morphological analysis is driven by the 
structural dependencies within the sentence. Equally, syntactic roles are disambiguated by 
morphological dependencies.  Thus, independent morphological and syntactic analyzers for 
Arabic are not adequate. 
</p>
<p>3 The Role of Dependency Grammar in Disambiguation 
Parsing morphologically rich, free word order languages is a challenging task. However, in 
case of Arabic, it is possible to employ the set of dependencies and constraints in 
disambiguation process. In many cases these dependencies are manifested by apparent case 
assignment, prefixing, infixing suffixing and agreement. Thus, the morphological analysis of a 
word-form, and in particular its morphological segmentation, cannot be disambiguated 
without reference to structural dependencies, and various morphological features of 
syntactically related forms provide useful hints for morphological and syntactic 
disambiguation. From the development point of view, processing and disambiguation of 
Arabic depend in the following sources of information: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; The lexicon: provides basic and initial information about lexical items 
(grammatical attribute).  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Adjacency constraints: specify the compatibility or the incompatibility of two 
neighboring morphemes. For example, a preposition cannot be followed by a 
preposition. 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Morphological dependencies (Mel&#8217;tchuk 1988): describes the type and direction 
inflected from one constituent to another. As shown in Figure 1 a verb that follows 
the subject should agree in number and gender, thus the verb is morphologically </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Daoud Daoud, Mohammad Daoud 
</p>
<p>dependent on the subject.  On the other hand, the subject is morphologically 
dependent on the verb in case ending.  
</p>
<p>&#8226; Syntactic dependencies (Mel&#8217;tchuk 1988): determine binary relations between the 
lexical items in the sentence. In Figure 1, the verb hit is the head of two boys 
(subject) and hani (object). 
</p>
<p>As shown figure 1, it is not necessarily that the syntactic dependent of a head is also 
morphologically dependent. Hit and the two boys are exhibiting mutual morphological 
dependencies.

</p>
<p>To demonstrate how the above information can be employed in disambiguation, consider the 
sentence shown in Figure 2. The ambiguity in the sentence is stemmed from the following two 
word forms:  
</p>
<p>&#1;&#14;&#1607;&#1584;
go (they/ two) (V)
gold (N) (tanween )

&#24;&#1607;&#1584;+&#1575;      &#1; (they went) or (gold [accusative]) 
</p>
<p>The disambiguation process is started by using the adjacency condition that a noun cannot be 
followed by a preposition (&#19;&#12;&#1575;  to). Thus, &#1;&#14;&#1607;&#1584; (they went) is a verb (go) [MASC, DUAL] not a 
noun. (Sami) &#16;&#17;&#1;&#18; (a named entity) cannot be the subject of the verb as there are no 
morphological dependencies (agreement in number).  On the other hand, a morphological 
dependencies exists between &#1;&#14;&#1607;&#1584;  and &#1;&#14;&#22;&#1;&#23;   suggesting that it is (two friends) and that it is the 
subject. This solution is verified by the existence of a morphological dependency between &#1;&#14;&#22;&#1;&#23; 
(two friends)  and &#16;&#17;&#1;&#18; (Sami): the suffix that indicates duality ending is &#1606;&#1575; (NOM), but when 
the noun is the first part of the IDAFA construction the suffix should be  &#1575;  which is the case in 
the above sentence. So, Sami is the second part of the IDAFA construction. </p>

<p>Figure 3: An example of syntactic dependencies disambiguation 
</p>
<p>In the sentence shown in figure 3, disambiguation is driven by syntactic dependencies. The 
verb (took) is the head of two dependents which are the subject and the object of (took).  This 
is considered a NUCLEAR PROCESS that contains two participants in association with a 
&#8216;process&#8217; element. Following (Dik 1989), any additional constituent is either: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Indirect participant in a process. 
&#8226; Additional information about a condition or circumstances pertaining to a process. 
</p>
<p>In Modern Standard Arabic, both indirect participants and circumstances are realized by two 
basic types of grammatical structure: 
</p>
<p>&#8226; Accusative nominals. 
&#8226; Prepositional phrases of various kinds. 
</p>
<p>This is left us with one solution to &#8220;&#1579;&#1585;&#1575;&#13;&#1570;&#8221;; it is a prepositional phrase, meaning &#8220;like/such as + 
inheritor&#8221;. Thus, it should be segmented correctly by recognizing the first character as a 
preposition (ka) and the rest of the morpheme as the word &#8220;&#1579;&#1585;&#1575;&#1608; inheritor&#8221;. This solution is 
verified by the existence of both syntactic and morphological dependencies with the word 
following it &#8220;&#22;&#25;&#16;&#26; legitimate&#8221;. 
</p>
<p>In light of the above, it is clear that in some cases syntactic dependencies provide cues to 
perform segmentation and morphological analysis. On the other hand, morphological analysis 
and adjacency constraints are necessary to disambiguate syntactic structures. Thus, the 
pipeline model (where morphology is performed first and syntactic processing follows) will 
not suffice.  In this model, a morphological analyzer provides all possible solutions to the 
syntactic parsing which leads to high magnitude of computational complexity of parsing. To 
demonstrate this, a word form in the Penn Arabic Treebank (ATB) has, on average, two 
morphological solutions (Nizar and Owen 2005). The complexity of any parsing algorithm 
will have a term order of: 
</p>
<p>&#8719;
=
</p>
<p>N
</p>
<p>i ia1   
</p>
<p>where ai is the number of alternative solutions of the ith word (Allan and Hanady 2008). 
Therefore, the average complexity of parsing a 20 words Arabic sentence using the pipeline 
model can reach up to 1048576 (2^20). Thus, linguistic information tend to be more effective 
at selecting between alternative solutions at the lower levels of the analysis and less effective 
at doing so at the higher levels (Macdonald, Pearlmutter et al. 1994). 
</p>
<p>Different systems that process Arabic with some degree of disambiguation are described in the 
literature (Othman, Shaalan et al. 2004; Allan and Hanady 2008; Attia 2008). All of them are 
rule-based systems adapting the pipeline model. Attia (Attia 2008) tried to reduce ambiguity 
by putting restriction on the lexical items during the morphological analysis phase. He </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Daoud Daoud, Mohammad Daoud 
</p>
<p>reported that his system took 141 minutes (CPU time) to parse a test suite of 229 sentences. 
The system described in (Allan and Hanady 2008) took a more restricted approach by 
selecting one solution during the morphological phase without having any syntactic 
information. Unfortunately, we could not use any of the above systems directly for 
comparisons. 
</p>
<p>On the other hand, statistical techniques have widely been applied to automatic morphological 
analysis for many languages including English, Turkish and Malay (Larkey, Ballesteros et al. 
2007). The main challenge for such systems is that in Arabic, any particular word will appear 
less often than in English for a given text length and type. Thus, an Arabic datasets will have a 
higher degree of sparseness than comparable English counterparts (Goweder and De Roeck 
2001). This is significant as it may affect the success of standard statistical techniques on 
Arabic data. However, Diab, Hacioglu, and Jurafsky (Diab, Hacioglu et al. 2004) reported a 
remarkable performance for Arabic morphological Analysis using Support Vector Machines 
(SVMs).  They claim above 99% accuracy on tokenization and 95.49 accuracy on POS 
tagging. Their tools are trained on a sample of 4519 sentence of ATB. For the same size of 
English dataset, they reported a 94.97 accuracy on POS tagging, a result that contradict the 
fact that the token to type ratio is smaller for Arabic texts than for comparably sized English 
texts (Goweder and De Roeck 2001; Larkey, Ballesteros et al. 2007).  Habash and Rambow 
(Nizar and Owen 2005) also reported  high accuracy rates in their system for tokenizing and 
morphologically tagging Arabic words. They used similar approach reported in (Diab, 
Hacioglu et al. 2004), but by incorporating the Buckwalter  morphological analyzer 
(Buckwalter 2002) into their system. However, Larkly, Ballesteros and Conner (Larkey, 
Ballesteros et al. 2007) reported that their simple light stemmer outperformed Diab&#8217;s 
morphological analyzer. One of their explanations to this result is: &#8220;Arabic text contains so 
many definite articles that one could obtain the claimed &gt;99% tokenization accuracy simply 
by removing AL from the beginning of words.&#8221; 
</p>
<p>Having this in mind, we will take a different approach from previous work. Our system is a 
rule-based one, which is conceptualized by using dependency grammar. Although dependency 
grammar has its roots to the work of early Arabic Grammarians (Kitab al-Usul of Ibn al- 
Sarraj,d. 928), all of the existing (rule-based) Arabic processing systems are built on phrase 
structure theory.  
</p>
<p>In the next section, we will describe our synchronized model, which is able to perform 
morphological and syntactic processing of Arabic in as single, integrated and synchronized 
framework, thus allowing shared information to support disambiguation in multiple levels. 
</p>
<p>4 The Computational Model 
Our system is coded using EnCo (Uchida 1999) which we used previously in developing the 
first Arabic-UNL enconverter. EnCo is a rule-based programming language specialized for the 
writing of enconverters (translators from a NL into UNL), and provided by the UNL center.  
</p>
<p>4.1 The UNL 
</p>
<p>Universal networking language (UNL)(Boguslavskij 2001; Uchida and Zhu 2001; Uchida and 
Zhu 2003; Boitet 2005) is a semantic, language independent representation of a sentence that 
mediates between the enconversion (analysis) and deconversion (generation). The pivot </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Arabic Disambiguation Using Dependency Grammar 
</p>
<p>paradigm is used: the representation of an utterance in the UNL interlingua is a hypergraph 
where normal nodes bear UWs (&quot;Universal Words&quot;, or interlingual acceptions) with semantic 
attributes, and arcs bear semantic relations [13]. The sentence &quot;Khaled bought a new car&quot; can 
be expressed in UNL as: 
</p>
<p>agt(buy(icl&gt;do(obj&gt;thing),icl&gt;purchase).@past.@entry, Khaled) 
obj(buy(icl&gt;do(obj&gt;thing),icl&gt;purchase).@past.@entry, car(icl&gt;automobile)) 
mod(car(icl&gt;automobile),new) 
 
</p>
<p>buy(icl&gt;do(obj&gt;thing),icl&gt;purchase).@past.@entry
</p>
<p>Khaled car(icl&gt;automobile)
</p>
<p>new
</p>

</p>
<p>m
od
</p>
<p> 
</p>
<p>Figure 4: A UNL graph 
</p>
<p>4.2 The EnCo rule-based programming language 
</p>
<p>EnCo(Uchida 1999) is a rule-based programming language specialized for the writing of 
enconverters1 . EnCo works in the following way. An input string is scanned from left to right. 
During the scan, all matched morphemes with the same starting characters are retrieved from 
the dictionary and become candidate morphemes. The rules are applied to these candidate 
morphemes, according to the rule priority, in order to build a semantic network for the 
sentence. The character string not yet scanned is then scanned from the beginning according to 
the applied rule; the process continues in the same manner. The output of the whole process is 
a semantic network expressed in the UNL format. If the dictionary retrieval or the rule 
application fails, it backtracks. 
</p>
<p>4.3 Overall Analysis Strategies Using EnCO 
</p>
<p>Developing EnCo rules requires a controlling mechanism that specifies which rule should be 
fired and which rules should not be fired. For that, we use tactical symbols written or removed 
from the input tape. Without using the KB (knowledge base), the only way to analyze Arabic 
is to depend on linguistic knowledge and on what exists in the sentence. Without having this 
controlling mechanism, this task would be impossible. 
For example, suppose we have the following sentence: 
&#1577;&#16;&#19;&#2;&#1570; &#29;&#25;&#16;&#30;&#1576; &#1577;&#11;&#10;&#11;&#31;&#12;&#1575; &#1577;&#1585;&#14;&#19;&#30;&#12;&#1575; &#11;&#12;&#14;  &#1602;&#14;&quot; 
</p>
<p>                                                
</p>
<p>1
 We use the term &#8220;enconverter&#8221;, and not &#8220;parser&#8221;, because the process involves a lexical transfer from the 
</p>
<p>&#8220;lexical space&#8221; of the NL at hand (while many have several &#8220;levels&#8221; such are morphs, morphemes, word 
forms, lexemes, lemmas, derivational lexical families, and  word senses) to the &#8220;lexical space&#8221; of UNL (the 
UWs, and their hierarchy). </p>

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>Daoud Daoud, Mohammad Daoud 
</p>
<p>Khalid drove the new car at a high speed. 
To analyze this sentence correctly, we should discover the boundaries of the entities that exist 
in the sentence. Since &#8220;Khalid&#8221; is not followed by an adjective, it is allowed to be an agent of 
the verb &#8220;drive&#8221; and it is removed from the node-list (tape). On the other hand, since &#8220;car&#8221; is 
followed by an adjective which has the same gender, it is not allowed for &#8220;car&#8221; to be an object 
before handling the adjective first (&#8220;car&#8221; is a dependent of &#8220;drive&#8221;, and &#8220;new&#8221; is a dependent 
of &#8220;car&#8221;: it is not allowed to process the head before its dependents).  
</p>
<p>4.3.1 Disambiguation Mechanism 
</p>
<p>At any particular moment in time, EnCo is in a describable configuration. Between this 
moment and the next discrete time stamp, the machine reads its input from the tape, refers to 
rules controlling its behavior, and considering both the input and the current configuration, 
determines what behavior to exhibit (i.e. erase/write on tape, move left, move right, create a 
an arc in the UNL graph, etc.), which determine the next configuration.

<p>All information needed for disambiguation (adjacency, morphological dependencies, and 
syntactic dependencies, in addition to basic lexical attributes retrieved from the dictionary) is 
accessible at any moment of processing. This information is expressed by the symbols 
attached to each node in the input tape. Figure 5, demonstrates the availability of syntactic 
dependencies needed to disambiguate &#8220;&#1579;&#1585;&#1575;&#7;&#1570;&#8221;. The engagement of the verb took in &#8220;agt&#8221; and 
&#8220;obj&#8221; relationships, provides information to the enconverter to perform the correct 
segmentation and word selection. More to the point, the enconverter will backtrack if it had 
done wrong selection. For example, consider the following rule: 
?R{V1,obj,agt:::}{NDE:::}P255; 
This rule will force the enconverter to backtrack when it reaches the following configuration: 
the left node is a verb engaged into two syntactic relations (agt and obj) and the right node is 
an entity or a noun. The UNL expression of (Sami took the money as a legitimate (valid) 
inheritor) is shown below:

To implement this enconverter 1500 rules were coded. Long sentences have been analyzed 
accurately with this system.  
To demonstrate this the following sentence was analyzed in only  .3 Sec CPU time:

<p>The Saudi team defeated Holland on Palestine Stadium in its last match in Sunday and the 
Saudi team was able to achieve victory by three wonderful goals as a result of their collective 
play, so the Saudi team reaches the finals achieving the dreams of the Saudi audience.

<p>5 Conclusion 
During the development period of the Arabic enconverter, the number of lexical items added 
to UNL-Arabic dictionary reached 120,000 entries. This covers the UWs provided by UNL 
center and the most frequent Arabic lexicon. More sophisticated features are added to each 
entry to cover morphological, syntactic and semantics aspects. In designing those features, we 
took into consideration the analysis and generation processes. Functional words are also added 
to the dictionary along with all prefixes and suffixes needed for Arabic morphology.  
</p>
<p>The synchronized computational model of EnCo with Dependency Grammar provides us with 
the right mean to disambiguate a language such as Arabic. This approach outperform pipeline 
model in terms of computational time and accuracy. Our system disambiguate efficiently 
words that exhibit ambiguities across different categories (noun-verb ambiguity, particle- verb 
ambiguity), but less efficient in words that fall within same category (noun-noun, verb-verb). 
This is expected, as morphological and syntactic dependencies become less decisive in 
disambiguation in those situations. Our future work will focus in this issue.
