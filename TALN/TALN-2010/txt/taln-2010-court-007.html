<p>Abstract General purpose, high quality and fully automatic MT is believed to be impossible. We are 
interested in scriptural translation problems, which are weak sub-problems of the general problem of 
translation. We introduce the characteristics of the weak problems of translation and of the scriptural 
translation problems, describe different computational approaches (finite-state, statistical and hybrid) to 
solve these problems, and report our results on several combinations of Indo-Pak languages and writing 
systems.

<p>1 Introduction 
We say that a problem of translation is weak if the sentence correspondence defined by that problem is 
such that there is always a very small number of target sentences corresponding to a given source 
sentence, if it is presented in isolation, and almost always only 1 target sentence in a given context. On the 
contrary, a general translation problem is strong because the number of target sentences corresponding to a 
source sentence of length n can be exponential (kn for some k), even in the context of a connected text. 
</p>
<p>Such weak translation problems include (1) transliteration or/and transcription between 2 scripts, which 
we call &#8220;scriptural translation&#8221;, (2) phonetic transcription, and (3) interdialectal translation, that implies 
lexical changes. Table 1 gives a list of some generic and specific sub-problems of weak translation 
problems and their instances in increasing complexity and difficulty order. 
</p>
<p>In this paper, we concentrate only on scriptural translation problems, because they are important in 
practice, especially for many Indo-Pak languages (that are spoken both in India and Pakistan), but also for 
other languages like Malay, Mongolian and many languages of Central Asia. Scriptural translation 
problems are significant because they create a scriptural divide that often reinforces political divisions and 
mutual misunderstandings, even if communities using different scripts perfectly understand each other </p>

</p>
<p>2 Scriptural Translation 
Scriptural translation is the process of transcribing a word written in the source language script into the 
target language script by preserving its articulation in the original language in such a way that the native 
speaker of the target language can produce the original pronunciation. It is a weak translation problem for 
Indo-Pak languages, but it is a strong translation problem Japanese-English and French-Chinese scriptural 
translation. An example of Hindi-Urdu scriptural translation is shown in Figure 1. 
</p>
<p>It differs from general transliteration in various aspects. 
Usually, transliteration handles only Out-Of-Vocabulary 
(OOV) words, Named Entities (NEs), etc. On the other 
hand, scriptural translation must handle all kinds of words 
irrespective of their type and it provides basis for Cross-
Scriptural Machine Translation (CSMT), Cross-Scriptural 
Information Retrieval (CSIR), Cross-Scriptural Application 
Development (CSAD), Inter-dialectal Machine Translation (IMT), Cross-Dialectal Information Retrieval 
(CDIR) and for solving the weak translation problems. 
</p>
<p>Scriptural translation problems are quite interesting theoretically because they often cannot be solved by a 
simple character-to-character replacement method. Even in their weak instances (such as Hindi-Urdu 
scriptural translation), they may be complex (need more than usual Finite-State Transducers (FST) to 
reach a quality high enough for real usage) and difficult (require human work to build resources, and 
expert knowledge). They offer the advantage that measures of accuracy based on references are valid, as 
there is in general only one &#8220;good&#8221; translation, which can serve as a reference.

<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>WEAK TRANSLATION PROBLEMS &#8211; A CASE STUDY OF SCRIPTURAL TRANSLATION 
</p>
<p>2.1 Challenges for scriptural translation 
</p>
<p>2.1.1 Scriptural divide 
</p>
<p>There exists a written communication gap between people who can understand each other verbally but 
cannot read each other. They are virtually divided and become scriptural aliens. Examples are the Hindi &amp; 
Urdu communities, the Punjabi/Shahmukhi &amp; Punjabi/Gurmukhi communities, etc. An example of 
scriptural divide is shown in Figure 1. 
</p>
<p>2.1.2 Under-resourcedness 
</p>
<p>Under-resourcedness of a source or target language is a big challenge for scriptural translation. The lack 
of standards in writing practices or code page for a language makes scriptural translation very hard. The 
existence of different writing systems for a language results in a large number of variants and it becomes 
difficult and complex to handle them. For example, Punjabi is the largest language of Pakistan (more than 
70 million), but there existed only two magazines in 1992 (Rahman 1997). In the words of (Rahman 
2004), &#8220;&#8230; there is little development in Punjabi, Pashto, Balochi and other languages&#8230;&#8221;. (Malik 2005) 
reports the first effort towards establishing a standard code page for Punjabi/Shahmukhi, and there is none 
yet for Shahmukhi. The Kashmiri and Seraiki languages are similarly under-resourced. 
</p>
<p>2.1.3 Missing necessary information 
</p>
<p>In some cases, the necessary and vital information for scriptural translation is missing in the source text. 
For example, the first word of the example sentence of Figure 1 &#1575;&#1610;&#1606;&#1583; [&#7699;&#650;n&#618;j&#593;] (world) misses essential 
information that is obligatory to do Urdu to Hindi transliteration. Diacritical marks are part of the writing 
system but are sparingly used in writings (Zia 1999). Figure 2(a) and 2 (b) show the correct and the wrong 
Hindi transliteration of the example Urdu word respectively. 
</p>
<p> 
Figure 2. Example of absence of information 
</p>
<p>2.1.4 Dissimilar spelling conventions 
</p>
<p>Different spelling conventions exist across different scripts used for the same language or for different 
languages because users of a script have learned to write certain words in a traditional way. For example, 
the words &#1729;&#1610; [je] (this) = &#1740; [j] + &#1729; [h] and &#1729;&#1608; [vo] (that) = &#1608; [v] + &#1729; [h] are used in Urdu and 
Punjabi/Shahmukhi. The character &#1729; [h] produces the vowel sounds [e] and [o] in the example words 
respectively. On the other hand, the example words are written as &#2351;&#2375; [je] &amp; &#2357;&#2379; [vo] and &#2607;&#2631; [je] &amp; &#2613; &#2635; [vo] in 
Devanagari and Gurmukhi, respectively. There exist a large number of such different conventions between 
Punjabi/Shahmukhi&#8211;Punjabi Gurmukhi, Hindi&#8211;Urdu, etc. 
</p>
<p>Different spelling conventions are also driven by different religious influences on different communities. 
In the Indian sub-continent, Hindi is a part of the Hindu identity, while Urdu is a part of the Muslim 
identity1 (Rahman 1997; Rai 2000). Hindi derives its vocabulary from Sanskrit, while Urdu borrows its

</p>
<p>literary and scientific vocabulary from Persian and Arabic. Hindi and Urdu not only borrow from Sanskrit 
and Persian/Arabic, but also adopt the original spellings of the borrowed word due the sacredness of the 
original language. These differences make scriptural translation across scripts, dialects or languages more 
challenging and complex. 
</p>
<p>2.1.5 Transliteration and Transcription Ambiguities 
</p>
<p>Transliteration or transcription at character level across different scripts is ambiguous. For example, a 
Sindhi word  &#1606;&#1575;&#1587;&#1606;&#1616;&#1575;[&#618;&#626;s&#593;n] (human being) can be transliterated into Devanagari either as &#2311;&#2306;&#2360;&#2366;&#2344; [&#618;&#626;s&#593;n] or &#2311;&#2360;&#2366;&#2344; 
* [&#618;ns&#593;n] (* means wrong spelling). The transliteration process of the word from Sindhi to Devanagari is 
shown in Figure 3(a). The transliteration of the third character from the left, Noon (&#1606;) [n] is ambiguous 
because in the middle of a word, Noon may represent a consonant [n] or the nasalization [&#626;] of a vowel. 
In the reverse direction, the Sindhi Devanagari word &#2311;&#2306;&#2360;&#2366;&#2344; 
[&#618;&#626;s&#593;n] can be transliterated into a set of possible 
transliterations [&#1606;&#1575;&#1587;&#1606;&#1616;&#1575;, &#1606;&#1575;&#1589;&#1606;&#1616;&#1575;*, &#1606;&#1575;&#1579;&#1606;&#1616;&#1575;*]; all of these possible 
transliterations have the same pronunciation [&#618;&#626;s&#593;n] but have 
different spellings in the Perso-Arabic script, as shown in 
Figure 3(b). Similar kinds of ambiguities also arise for other 
pairs of scripts or languages. Thus transliteration ambiguities increase the complexity and hardness of the 
scriptural translation across scripts of the same language or of different languages.

<p>3.1 Finite-state scriptural translation system using UIT 
Universal Intermediate Transcription (UIT) is a multipurpose pivot. It is used as a phonetico-morphotactic 
intermediate representation for the surface morphotactic translation or scriptural translation. It is a 
deterministic and an unambiguous scheme of transcription for Indo-Pak languages based on Speech

<p>Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet (SAMPA) in ASCII range 32&#8211;126, since a text in this range is 
portable across computers and operating systems (Hieronymus 1993; Wells 1995). 
</p>
<p>In our finite-state model, UIT serves the purpose of a phonetico-scriptural pivot. The source text is 
converted into its UIT representation and this UIT representation is then transformed into the target text. 
Therefore, scriptural translation is a &#8220;double translation&#8221;. We have used FST to perform these two 
scriptural translations. Our FST model is shown in Figure 4(a) and fully discussed in (Malik et al. 2008). 
We have developed FSTs for this double translation for Hindi-Urdu, Punjabi and Seraiki. 
</p>
<p>3.2 SMT systems 
SMT systems are direct translation systems for the Hindi-Urdu pair. They have been developed from a 
parallel lexicon containing 50,000 Hindi-Urdu words. Each parallel entry contains Hindi and Urdu 
scripturally parallel words. A space has been introduced after each character in each Hindi and Urdu 
parallel word to develop Hindi-Urdu parallel training data at characters-level. In character-level SMT 
systems, a character is a translation unit, exactly like a word in an SMT system for the English-French 
pair, developed from English-French parallel corpora. 
</p>
<p>We have also developed an expert clustering algorithm to build cluster-level parallel training data. A 
cluster is a set of characters that must be considered as one translation unit. For example, in Punjabi, an 
aspirated consonant is written as a combination of the consonant to be aspirated and HEH-
DOACHASHMI (&#1607;), and these two characters must be considered as one translation unit for scriptural 
translation. Therefore, we have two types of SMT systems, (1) character-level and (2) cluster-level. To 
check the effect of different parameters on our SMT systems, like reordering and tuning, we have varied 
these parameters during the development phase. In short, we have developed 12 SMT systems for Hindi to 
Urdu scriptural translation, and another set of 12 SMT systems for Urdu to Hindi scriptural translation. 
</p>
<p>3.3 Hybrid model 
In the case of Indo-Pak languages, Urdu, Seraiki and Punjabi are written in Pakistan in a derivation of the 
Persio-Arabic script. Like for Arabic, people do not usually use the diacritical marks, which contain very 
crucial information to perform scriptural translation from that script to the other script used (usually a 
variant of Devanagari). Our FST model is a kind of expert system, and missing information badly affects 
its performance. On the other hand, SMT is a data-driven model, but the results are still not satisfactory as 
far as usability in real context is considered.  
</p>
<p>To compensate the absence of necessary information and produce sufficient results, we have proposed a 
hybrid model (Malik et al. 2009). This model is a multilevel process. It firsts performs the scriptural 
translation of the source text in the target language/script and relates each source word with a set of target 
words. The cardinality of this relation is 1 in most cases, but can reach at maximum of 4. The target 
language model is used as a statistical filter that uses the target language knowledge to filter out incorrect 
solutions and produce the correct one. The concept of our hybrid model is shown in Figure 5.

<p>4 Results 
For automatic testing purposes, we manually developed a Hindi-Urdu test corpus, containing 200 
sentences (4,250 words). We randomly selected 200 sentences from our Hindi corpus and then translated 
them into Urdu. The results of our different computational models are given in Table 2. For SMT, we have 
only reported the best results.

<p>5 Conclusion 
The weak translation problems are sub-problems of translation that only admit a very small set of correct 
solutions, in general only one, for a given source sentence in a given context. Scriptural translation, a 
weak sub-problem of translation, is almost always a weak problem. Three approaches have been employed 
to solve scriptural translation problems and results have been reported for Urdu to Hindi scriptural 
translation. We found that the hybrid approach gives better results than the FST and SMT approaches. The 
analysis of scriptural translation leads to the conclusion that the weak translation problems, which seemed 
to be simple on the first hand, can be complex and hard problems.
