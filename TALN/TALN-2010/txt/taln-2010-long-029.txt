Résumé.        De nombreux travaux en Traduction Automatique Statistique (TAS) pour des langues d’en-
trée morphologiquement riches montrent que la ségmentation morphologique et la normalisation orthogra-
phique améliorent la qualité des traductions en diminuant la sparsité des données. Dans cet article, nous
étudions l’impact de ce prétraitement pour la TAS vers une langue de sortie riche morphologiquement,
comme l’Arabe. Nous explorons l’espace des schémas de segmentation et des options de normalisation
possibles. Nous évaluons seulement la sortie sous une forme désegmentée et enrichie orthographiquement.
Nos résultats montrent d’une part que le meilleur schéma pour la ségmentation est celui de la Penn Arabic
Treebank. D’autre part, la meilleure procédure de prétraitement consiste à entraîner le système sur des
données normalisées orthographiquement, puis à enrichir et désegmenter les traductions en sortie.
Abstract.         Much of the work on Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) from morphologically rich
languages has shown that morphological tokenization and orthographic normalization help improve SMT
quality because of the sparsity reduction they contribute. In this paper, we study the effect of these pro-
cesses on SMT when translating into a morphologically rich language, namely Arabic. We explore a space
of tokenization schemes and normalization options. We only evaluate on detokenized and orthographi-
cally correct (enriched) output. Our results show that the best performing tokenization scheme is that
of the Penn Arabic Treebank. Additionally, training on orthographically normalized (reduced) text then
jointly enriching and detokenizing the output outperforms training on enriched text.

1   Introduction

Most of the published research on statistical machine translation (SMT) for Arabic focuses on Arabic-to-
English. Recently, however, translation into Arabic has been receiving increasing attention (Sarikaya &
Deng, 2007; Badr et al., 2008, 2009; Elming & Habash, 2009; El Kholy & Habash, 2010). In this paper,
we consider some of the lessons learned from working on Arabic-English MT and their applicability to
the English-Arabic direction. In particular we focus on two techniques : morphological tokenization (for
short tokenization) and orthographic normalization (for short normalization). The common wisdom in the
field of natural language processing (NLP) is that tokenization of Arabic words through decliticization
and reductive orthographic normalization is helpful for MT into English because of the sparsity reduction
they contribute. We explore a space of tokenization schemes and normalization options and their impli-
cations on the quality of English-Arabic MT. Regardless of the preprocessing choices, the Arabic output
is detokenized and denormalized. Anything less is comparable to producing all lower cased English or
uncliticized and undiacritized French. The focus of this paper is on the value of tokenization and normali-
zation for SMT. For a detailed discussion of detokenization and denormalization for Arabic, see (El Kholy
& Habash, 2010).
This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 briefly discusses some related work. Section 3 introduces
relevant linguistic issues. Sections 4 and 5 present our approach and experimental results, respectively.
2   Related Work

Much of the work done on studying the effects of morphological preprocessing on SMT quality focuses on
translation from morphologically rich languages such as German (Nießen & Ney, 2004), Czech (Goldwa-
ter & McClosky, 2005) and Arabic (Habash & Sadat, 2006; Lee, 2004; Zollmann et al., 2006). They show
that reducing the sparsity caused by rich morphology through some form of morphological tokenization
has a positive impact on the quality of SMT . There is also a growing number of publications that consider
translation into morphologically rich languages such as Turkish (Oflazer & Durgar El-Kahlout, 2007) and
Arabic (Sarikaya & Deng, 2007; Badr et al., 2008; El Kholy & Habash, 2010). We focus here on efforts
that studied the impact of morphological preprocessing on Arabic as a target language. Sarikaya & Deng
(2007) use joint morphological-lexical language models to re-rank the output of English-dialectal Arabic
MT. Badr et al. (2008) report results on the value of morphological tokenization of Arabic during training
and describe different techniques for detokenizing Arabic output. The research presented here is most clo-
sely related to that of Badr et al. (2008). We extend on their contribution in two ways : (a.) we present a
comparison of a larger number of tokenization schemes that yielded improved results over theirs ; and (b)
we discuss the technical challenges and solutions of producing unnormalized Arabic output whereas they
only reported results on normalized Arabic. We will compare to their work as appropriate throughout the
paper. Finally, in a previous publication (El Kholy & Habash, 2010) , we presented an extension to Badr
et al. (2008)’s work on detokenization. We do not discuss the details of this work here ; however, we use
our best previously reported detokenization setting for the experiments in this paper (see Section 4.3).

3.1   Arabic Orthography

Certain letters in Arabic script are often spelled inconsistently which leads to an increase in both spar-
sity (multiple forms of the same word) and ambiguity (same form corresponding to multiple words). In
particular, variants of Hamzated Alif, Â 1 or A,   ˇ are often written without their Hamza ( ’) : A ; and
the Alif-Maqsura (or dotless Ya)        ý and the regular dotted Ya      y are often used interchangeably in
word final position. This inconsistent variation in raw Arabic text is typically addressed in Arabic NLP
through what is called orthographic normalization, a reductive process that converts all Hamzated Alif
forms (including Alif Madda A)   ¯ to bare Alif and dotless Ya/Alif Maqsura form to dotted Ya. This kind
of normalization is referred to as a Reduced normalization (R ED). R ED normalization is contrasted with
Enriched normalization (E NR), which selects the appropriate form of the Alif and Ya in context (El Kholy
& Habash, 2010). E NR Arabic is optimally the desired form of Arabic to generate and to evaluate against.
Comparing a manually enriched (E NR) version of the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) (Maamouri et al.,
2004) to its reduced (R ED) version, we find that 16.2% of the words are different. However, the raw (na-
turally unnormalized) version of the PATB is only different in 7.4% of the words. This suggests a major
problem in the recall of the correct E NR form in raw text. In internal experiments, we noticed that BLEU-4
(Papineni et al., 2002) scores drop about 10 % absolute when comparing E NR to raw (as opposed to E NR)
and about 5 % when comparing R ED to raw (as opposed to R ED) for the same output. As such we only
evaluate results against references with their matching normalization condition (E NR or R ED).

3.2   Arabic Morphology

Arabic is a morphologically complex language with a large set of morphological features producing a
large number of rich word forms. While the number of (morphologically untokenized) Arabic words in a
parallel corpus is 20% less than the number of corresponding English words, the number of unique Arabic
word types is over twice the number of unique English word types over the same corpus size.
One aspect of Arabic that contributes to this complexity is its various attachable clitics. We define three
degrees of cliticization that are applicable in a strict order to a word base (Habash & Sadat, 2006) :

[cnj+ [prt+ [art+ BASE +pron]]]
1. All Arabic transliterations are provided in the Habash-Soudi-Buckwalter transliteration scheme (Habash et al., 2007).
A HMED E L K HOLY, N IZAR H ABASH

At the deepest level, the BASE can have either the definite article (+ Al+ ‘the’) or a member of the class
of pronominal enclitics, +pron, (e.g., + +hm ‘their/them’). Next comes the class of particle proclitics
(prt+), e.g., + l+ ‘to/for’. At the shallowest level of attachment we find the conjunction proclitic (cnj+),
e.g., + w+ ‘and’. The attachment of clitics to word forms is not a simple concatenation process. There
are several orthographic and morphological adjustment rules that are applied to the word. Some examples
of these rules are presented in Table 1 and an almost complete list of the rules is presented and exemplified
in (El Kholy & Habash, 2010).
It is important to make the distinction here between simple word segmentation, which splits off word
substrings with no orthographic/morphological adjustments, and morphological tokenization, which does.
Although segmentation by itself can have important advantages, it leads to the creation of inconsistent or
ambiguous word forms : consider the words             mktb ‘a library’ and        mktbthm ‘their library’.
A simple segmentation of the second word creates the non-word string           mktbt ; however, applying
adjustment rules as part of the tokenization generates the same form of the basic word in the two cases.
See example of Ta-Marbuta rule in Table 1. In this paper, we do not explore morphological tokenization
beyond decliticization (details in the next section).

4     Approach
We would like to study the value of a variety of tokenization schemes and orthographic normalizations
on English-Arabic SMT. Yet our goal is to always produce correctly detokenized and orthographically
enriched Arabic words. To that end, we consider the following variants.

4.1   Orthographic Normalization

Throughout our experiments, we consider two kinds of orthographic normalization schemes, enriched
Arabic (E NR) and reduced Arabic (R ED) ; but we always target enriched Arabic E NR. For R ED systems,
we jointly detokenize and enrich the output as explained later in this section.
For comparison reasons, we report results in both R ED and E NR Arabic forms. We only compare in the
matching form, i.e., R ED hypothesis to R ED reference and E NR hypothesis to E NR reference.

4.2   Morphological Tokenization

We consider five tokenization schemes discussed in the literature, in addition to a baseline no-tokenization
scheme (D0). The D1, D2, TB and D3 schemes were first presented by Habash & Sadat (2006) and the
S2 scheme was presented by Badr et al. (2008). The S1 scheme used by Badr et al. (2008) is the same
as Habash & Sadat (2006)’s D3 scheme. TB is the PATB tokenization scheme. We use the Morphological
Analysis and Disambiguation for Arabic (MADA) toolkit (Habash & Rambow, 2005) to produce the
various tokenization schemes. Figure 1 illustrates the different tokenization schemes with an example.
Table 2 presents definitions and various relevant statistics for each tokenization scheme. The schemes
differ widely in terms of the increase of number of tokens and the corresponding type count reduction.
The more verbose schemes, i.e., schemes with more splitting and higher number of word tokens, have a
lower number of token types, which leads to lower out-of-vocabulary (OOV) rates and lower perplexity ;
however, they are also harder to predict correctly. The increase in the number of tokens has consequences
on word alignment, translation models and language models (LM). We control for these effects in our
experiments in Section 5.

MT04 test set while prediction error rates are measured against a Penn Arabic Treebank devset.
4.3    Detokenization and Orthographic Enrichment

All of the systems trained with tokenizations other than D0 require detokenization into correct Arabic
word forms. After exploring a set of techniques discussed in (El Kholy & Habash, 2010), we use their best
detokenization technique labeled T+R+LM. The technique crucially utilizes a lookup table (T) mapping
tokenized forms to detokenized forms. The table is based on pairs of tokenized and detokenized words
from our LM data which had been processed by MADA (Habash & Rambow, 2005). In run time, alter-
natives are given different conditional probabilities, P (detokenized|tokenized), derived from the tables.
Tokenized words absent from the tables are detokenized using deterministic rules (R) such as those exem-
plified in Table 1 as a back off strategy. We use a 5-gram untokenized-form LM and the disambig utility
in the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002) to decide among different alternatives. To jointly detokenize and en-
rich, special tables mapping tokenized R ED words to detokenized E NR words are used with E NR language
models (E NR-LM).
A HMED E L K HOLY, N IZAR H ABASH

We compare the performance of the detokenization technique (T+R+LM) for different tokenization schemes
and normalization conditions. The results are measured against the Arabic side of the NIST MTEval
MT04+MT05 test sets, which together have 2,409 sentences comprising 64,554 words. We report the re-
sults in Table 3 in terms of word-level detokenization error rate (W ER) and sentence-level detokenization
error rate (S ER). S ER is the percentage of sentences with at least one incorrectly detokenized word.
Overall, the more verbose schemes are harder to detokenize. There are some exceptions, however. D1 and
D2 results are exactly the same when the detokenization is made under the same normalization condition.
In the case of detokenizing and enriching jointly, D2 shows a slight improvement. This could be explained
by the fact that tokenization is helpful in disambiguating some cases in interaction with the LM. However,
with more splitting, the task becomes harder and the benefits are diminished. This could be especially
noticed in the jump of W ER and S ER between D2 and TB. This jump is tied to the harder detokenization
decisions associated with pronominal enclitics (+pron). All the results of the joint detokenization and
enrichment are very close because they all depend on the same LM. S2 and D3 only vary in clustering
proclitics and are exactly the same otherwise as far as detokenization is concerned.

5     Experiments
5.1    Experimental Data

All of the training data we use is available from the Linguistic Data Consortium (LDC). 2 We use an
English-Arabic parallel corpus of about 142K sentences and 4.4 million words for translation model trai-
ning data. The parallel text includes Arabic News (LDC2004T17), eTIRR (LDC2004E72), English trans-
lation of Arabic Treebank (LDC2005E46), and Ummah (LDC2004T18). Word alignment is done using
GIZA++ (Och & Ney, 2003). For language modeling, we use 200M words from the Arabic Gigaword
Corpus (LDC2007T40) together with the Arabic side of our training data. Twelve LMs were built for all
combinations of normalization and tokenization schemes. We used 5-grams for all LMs unlike Badr et al.
(2008), who used different n-grams sizes for tokenized and untokenized variants. All LMs are implemen-
ted using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).
MADA is used to preprocess the Arabic text for translation modeling and language modeling to produce
enriched forms and tokenizations. It can predict the correct enriched form of Arabic words at 99.4%. 3
English preprocessing simply includes down-casing, separating punctuation and splitting off “’s”.

TABLE 4 – Baseline SMT experiments with D0 tokenization. All results are in BLEU.
Due to the fact that the number of tokens per sentence changes from one tokenization scheme to another,
GIZA++’s initial sentence-length filters will drop more sentences from the more verbose schemes. The
percentage of sentences dropped due to the filtration process can be up to 2.3% in D3 (versus D0) for a
generic cut off of 100 tokens per sentence in Arabic. It may seem like a small percentage ; but since all
dropped sentences are very long, this leads to D0 having access to 6.6 % extra words in training over D3.
To control for this issue, we filter the training data so that all experiments are done on the same sentences.
We use the D3 tokenization scheme as a reference and set the cutoff at 100 D3 tokens.
All experiments are conducted using the Moses phrase-based SMT system (Koehn et al., 2007). The de-
coding weight optimization was done using a set of 300 sentences from the 2004 NIST MT evaluation test
set (MT04). The tuning is based on tokenized Arabic without detokenization. We use a maximum phrase
length of size 8 for all tokenizations. We report results on the 2005 NIST MT evaluation set (MT05).
These test sets were created for Arabic-English MT and have 4 English references. We use only one Ara-
bic reference in reverse direction for both tuning and testing. We evaluate using BLEU-4 (Papineni et al.,
2002) although we are aware of its caveats (Callison-Burch et al., 2006).

5.2   Baseline System

For our baseline system, using D0 tokenization, we compare the value of using lemmas for automatic
word alignment as opposed to word surface forms (E NR or R ED). In both cases, the phrase tables are
built using the surface forms. We compare different combinations of settings for translation models and
post-processing. For translation models, we either train on E NR or R ED text. As for post-processing, we
either keep the output as is, reduce it or enrich it. The enrichment is done using a variant of the E NR-LM
technique discussed in Section 4.3. In this experiment set, we did not use the D3-based length filtering
described above. The D3-based length filtering is used in the next section. The results in Table 4 show
that lemma-based alignment consistently yields superior results to surface-based alignment for the same
translation model and post-processing conditions. The rest of the experiments in this paper will all use
lemma-based alignment in the following manner : when aligning a verbose tokenization, the lemma form
will be used instead of the base word and the separated clitics will not be modified. Table 4 also shows
that E NR training is better than R ED training ; however, since automatic enrichment error increases with
tokenization verbosity (see Table 2, column 10), it is not clear which normalization settings is best to use
with verbose schemes. We explore these combinations next.

sults are presented in Table 5. The best performer across all conditions is the TB scheme. The previously
reported best performer was S2 (Badr et al., 2008), which was only compared against D0 and D3 toke-
nizations. Our results are consistent with Badr et al. (2008)’s results regarding D0 and D3. However, our
TB result outperforms S2. The differences between TB and all other conditions are statistically signifi-
cant above the 95% level. Statistical significance is computed using paired bootstrap resampling (Koehn,
2004). Training over R ED Arabic then enriching its output sometimes yields better results than training on
E NR directly which is the case with the TB tokenization scheme. However, sometimes the opposite is true
as demonstrated in the D3 results. This is likely due to a tradeoff between the quality of translation and
the quality of detokenization.
Contrasting the results in Table 5 for D0 with the first half (Lemma) in Table 4 highlights the effect of
length-based filtering. The systems in Table 4 have 6.6% more words in their training than the correspon-
ding systems in the D0 row in Table 5. The additional words contribute an absolute increase of 0.62 BLEU
points (2.5% relative increase) in the E NR settings and a little below half of that in the R ED settings.

5.4   Learning Curve Experiments

We also compare the value of different schemes across a learning curve where we consider smaller sets
of our data : 2M, 1M and 0.5M words. We only show results for the reduced-then-enriched systems in
Table 6. As expected, the increase in training data size causes an increase in BLEU scores. Both TB and
S2 at the 2M level outperform D0 at the 4M level. The TB scheme is almost always the top performer. The
S2 scheme goes from being ranked fourth in the smallest condition to being second in the largest. Further
experiments considering the same learning curve with E NR training may be necessary to understand how
different normalization settings interact with training size.

6     Conclusions and Future Work
We presented experiments studying a large number of variables for English-Arabic SMT systems that
produce correctly tokenized and enriched Arabic text. The results shows that the lemma based alignment
leads to a better output quality. Our best system uses the Penn Arabic Treebank (TB) tokenization scheme
and reduced Arabic word forms followed by a language-model based joint detokenization and enrichment
step. In the future we plan to investigate the use of system combination techniques and language modeling

approaches that target Arabic’s complex morphology such as factored LMs (Bilmes & Kirchhoff, 2003).
We also plan to study the effect of using more data and explore other morphological tokenization schemes.
Moreover, we plan to investigate the different types of MT errors in order to build detokenization systems
that are robust to MT errors.
