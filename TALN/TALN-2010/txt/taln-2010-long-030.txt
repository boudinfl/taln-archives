Résumé.          Distinguer les constructions verbe-sujet (VS) des propositions principales (“matrice”) et
subordonnées (“non-matrice”) améliore notre nouveau modèle de réordonnancement pour l’alignement
des mots en Traduction Automatique Statistique (TAS) arabe-anglais (Carpuat et al., 2010). D’une part, la
majorité des constructions verbe-sujet (VS) dans les propositions principales doivent être réordonnancées
en anglais, alors que l’ordre du verbe et du sujet est préservé dans la moitié des cas de constructions VS
subordonnées. D’autre part, nous constatons que notre analyseur syntaxique parvient à mieux identifier
les constructions VS des propositions principales. Ces observations nous amènent à limiter le réordon-
nancement des constructions VS à celles des propositions principales lors de l’alignement des mots. Cette
technique améliore substantiellement la performance d’un système de TAS conventionnel, et d’un sys-
tème qui réordonnance toutes les constructions VS. L’amélioration des mesures BLEU et TER obtenue
par simple réordonnancement représente presque la moitié de l’amélioration obtenue lorsque le modèle
d’alignement des mots est entraîné sur un corpus parallèle d’une taille cinq fois supérieure.
Abstract.          We improve our recently proposed technique for integrating Arabic verb-subject construc-
tions in SMT word alignment (Carpuat et al., 2010) by distinguishing between matrix (or main clause)
and non-matrix Arabic verb-subject constructions. In gold translations, most matrix VS (main clause
verb-subject) constructions are translated in inverted SV order, while non-matrix (subordinate clause)
VS constructions are inverted in only half the cases. In addition, while detecting verbs and their subjects
is a hard task, our syntactic parser detects VS constructions better in matrix than in non-matrix clauses.
As a result, reordering only matrix VS for word alignment consistently improves translation quality over
a phrase-based SMT baseline, and over reordering all VS constructions, in both medium- and large-scale
settings. In fact, the improvements obtained by reordering matrix VS on the medium-scale setting remar-
kably represent 44% of the gain in BLEU and 51% of the gain in TER obtained with a word alignment
training bitext that is 5 times larger.

1     Introduction
Translating Arabic verb subjects into English is challenging for current feature-poor Statistical Machine
Translation (SMT) models : Arabic subjects can occur in pre-verbal (SV), post-verbal (VS) or pro-dropped
constructions ; gender and number agreement rules differ in SV and VS orders ; and recursive possessive
constructions introduce long distance dependencies. This suggests that translating Arabic subjects to En-
glish requires complex long-distance reordering. However, standard SMT distance-based reordering mo-
dels used for word alignment (Och & Ney, 2003) and decoding (Koehn et al., 2007) are not well suited to
this task. Most syntax-aware phrase-based models do not capture verb subject information either, as they
typically rely on phrase-structure representations (Marton & Resnik (2008) inter alia). As a result, subject
translations are often garbled, while verbs are frequently incorrectly translated or even dropped.
We have recently shown that reordering VS constructions for word alignment improves Arabic-English
translation (Carpuat et al., 2010). However, unlike in previous syntactic reordering approaches, subjects
are moved back to the original VS word order before phrase-extraction and decoding. This strategy suc-
cessfully leverages subject span information, while acknowledging the poor quality of automatic VS de-
tection. To the best of our knowledge, the only other attempt at explicitly modeling Arabic subjects for
translation failed to improve phrase-based SMT (Green et al., 2009).
In the experiments described in (Carpuat et al., 2010), we obtain improvements in translation quality
despite using an overly simplistic reordering rule : all VS subjects are reordered, while analysis shows
that almost 30% of Arabic VS constructions are translated in the same order in English. In a follow-up
analysis, we manually inspected the data and found that many monotone VS occur in subordinate clauses.
This suggested that distinguishing between matrix (main) vs. non-matrix (subordinate) subjects might
provide additional insights.
In this paper, we show that limiting reordering to matrix VS subjects further improves SMT on both
medium- and large-scale settings. This simple but crucial modification of the reordering rule is motivated
by two observations :
– First, we show that matrix and non matrix VS have very different reordering patterns. Using a manually
word-aligned Arabic-English corpus, we discover that while most matrix VS constructions are translated
in inverted order (SV), non-matrix VS constructions are inverted in only half the cases.
– Second, while detecting verbs and their subjects is a hard task, our syntactic parser detects VS construc-
tions better in matrix than in non-matrix clauses. Reordering only matrix VS therefore introduces less
noise due to incorrect parses than reordering all VS.

2     Relevant linguistic facts
Arabic is a morpho-syntactically complex language with many differences from English. We describe here
two linguistic features of Arabic that are relevant to Arabic-English translation and how we handle them :
Arabic’s complex morphology, and verb-subject order. 1
First, Arabic words are morphologically complex containing clitics whose translations are represented se-
parately in English and sometimes in a different order. For instance, possessive pronominal enclitics are
attached to the noun they modify in Arabic but their translation precedes the English translation of the
noun : +       kitAbu+hu 2 ‘book+his → his book’. Other clitics include the definite article + Al+ ‘the’,

1. Other cases of Arabic constructions undergo complex reordering too when translated to English, e.g., Noun-Noun (Idafa)
and Noun-Adjective constructs. They are usually easily handled in phrase-based SMT system using a relatively short phrase
size and local distortion. As such, we do not offer any solutions other than the basic phrase-based MT setup.
2. All Arabic transliterations are presented in the HSB transliteration scheme (Habash et al., 2007).

F IGURE 2 – An example of long distance reordering of Arabic VS order into English SV order

the conjunction + w+ ‘and’ and the preposition + l+ ‘of/for’, among others. Separating some of these
clitics has been shown to help SMT (Habash & Sadat, 2006). In this paper we do not investigate which
clitics to separate, but instead we use the Penn Arabic Treebank (PATB) (Maamouri et al., 2004) tokeni-
zation scheme which splits all clitics except for the definite article + Al+ (see example in Figure 1). We
tokenize our data using the Morphological Analysis and Disambiguation for Arabic (MADA) toolkit (Ha-
bash & Rambow, 2005), for both parser training purposes and SMT (word alignment, phrase extraction,
and decoding).
Second, the subject in Arabic verb / subject constructions may be : (a.) pro-dropped (conjugated verb), (b.)
pre-verbal (SV), or (c.) post-verbal (VS). Each situation comes with its own morphosyntactic restrictions.
Generally, verbs agree with subjects in person, gender and number in SV order, but only in person and
gender in VS order. From the point of reordering, the case of VS order is the most interesting in the context
of translation to English (see Figure 1). For small noun phrases (NP), phrase-based SMT might be able to
handle the reordering in the phrase table if the verb and subject were seen in training. But this becomes
much less likely with very long NPs that exceed the size of the phrases in a phrase table. Figure 2 illustrates
this point : Boldface and italics are used to mark the verb and subordinating conjunction that surround the
subject NP (11 tokens) in Arabic and what they map to in English, respectively. Additionally, since Arabic
is a pro-drop language, we cannot “blindly” move the NP following the verb, since it can be the object
of that verb, or a subject of another verb (e.g., in a subordinate clause). A mistaken identification of the
subject boundaries can lead to moving part of the subject before the verb and keeping the rest after, which
is likely to hurt word alignment. These observations illustrate the importance of having a suitable syntactic
analyzer that can not only identify the boundaries of noun phrases (and other potential subjects) but also
assign them the correct relation to the correct verb in the sentence.

3    Subjects of matrix and non-matrix verbs are reordered differently
We previously reported that, while almost all Arabic SVs are translated in a monotone order in English,
the picture is more complex for VS constructions (Carpuat et al., 2010) : the majority of Arabic VS are
reordered into English, but 27% are translated in a monotone order. In this paper, we show that reordering
patterns of Arabic VS constructions into English are surprisingly different for matrix and non-matrix verbs.
We study the reordering patterns of SV and VS constructions in the manually word-aligned parallel Arabic-
English Treebank (LDC2009E82). Given the gold Arabic trees and the gold Arabic-English word align-
ments, we can determine the gold reorderings for SV and VS constructions. We extract verb and subject
representations from the gold constituent parses by deterministic conversion to the simplified dependency
structure of the Columbia Arabic Treebank (CATiB) (Habash & Roth, 2009). We then check whether the
English translations of the Arabic verb and the Arabic subject occur in the same order as in Arabic (mo-
notone) or not (inverted). Table 1 summarizes the reordering patterns for each category : Interestingly, VS
in matrix clauses are reordered much more frequently (81%) than non-matrix VS (48%). In contrast, both
matrix and non-matrix SV almost always translate into a monotone order in English. Manual inspection
reveals that the monotone VS translations are mostly explained by changes to passive voice or to non
verbal constructions in the English translation.

4    Arabic VS constructions are hard to identify
Before turning to translation, we need to tackle the prerequisite task of identifying Arabic post-verbal
subjects, their spans, and the verbs they attach to (and potentially reorder with). Most statistical syntactic
parsers that are used in SMT are constituency parsers (Bikel, 2004; Manning & Schuetze, 1999), and do
not typically mark subject relations explicitly. In contrast, and as in (Carpuat et al., 2010), we employ a
dependency parser – MaltParser with the Nivre "eager" algorithm (Nivre, 2003; Nivre et al., 2006) – as
follows : We train the parser on the training portion of the University of Pennsylvania Arabic Treebank
(PATB) part 3 (v3.1)(Maamouri et al., 2004), with the dev/test split defined by (Zitouni et al., 2006). Ins-
pired by the Columbia Arabic Treebank (CATiB) (Habash & Roth, 2009), we convert the PATB annotation
to a simplified format with 8 dependency relations and 6 POS tags, to gain higher POS prediction accu-
racy. We then extend it to a set of 44 tags using regular expressions of the basic POS and a linguistically
motivated set of affixes of the normalized surface word forms. Further discussion and subsequent work on
R EORDERING M ATRIX P OST- VERBAL S UBJECTS FOR A RABIC - TO -E NGLISH SMT

the extended CATiB POS tag set can be found in (Marton et al., 2010).
Evaluated on the PATB part 3v3.1 dev set, our parsing model achieves an overall labeled attachment
score of 79.25%, using MADA predicted (non-gold) POS tags. However, in this paper, we are specifically
interested in (a) detection of subjects (with their correct span) in constructions with verbs, and (b) detection
of the verb that governs each subject and which determines where the subject moves to. Hence, we argue
that combined detection statistics of verbs and their subjects (VATS) constructions are more telling when
evaluating parsing quality for reordering. 3 Table 4 includes overall precision/recall/F-score statistics for
all VATS and for each type of verbal construction (VS, SV and VNS) regardless of matricity and also for
matrix/non-matrix conditions.
Overall, identifying VATS is hard, with 74% F-score. Matrix VATS are much harder to detect – almost
9% absolute lower than non-matrix VATS. Some of the difference is the result of mis-identifying whether
the verb is a matrix verb or not. Ignoring matricity, our main target (VS construction) has the lowest per-
formance of all constructions. That said, the VS construction has a much better performance in the harder
matrix condition than the non-matrix condition. This is rather different from the other two constructions
which fare better in the non-matrix condition.
It should be noted that verb identification (i.e., verb regardless of its subject) is almost perfect (F-score
of 99.88% and 100% recall), 4 and that matrix verb identification precision is almost 93%. That said, the
low precision of the matrix VNS condition (56.37% in Table 4) suggests that most errors of VS and SV
are likely to be errors of unidentified subjects, i.e., the verbs are considered VNS, as opposed to incorrect
subject spans).

While we intend to work on improving verb-subject detection accuracy, it is also worth exploring whether
the current noisy matrix VS detection can still help Arabic-English phrase-based SMT.
3. We divert from the CATiB representation in that a non-matrix subject of a pseudo verb (          ) is treated as a subject
of the verb that is under the same pseudo verb. This treatment of said subjects is comparable to the PATB’s. Note also that a
matrix subject or verb that is mis-identified as non-matrix, or vice versa, does not get credit in our scoring ; neither does a
partially detected span.
4. Note that this evaluation starts with gold tokenization.

5        Reordering matrix Arabic VS for SMT word alignment
Based on the analysis of gold reordering patterns and our automatic subject detection tools, we introduce a
simple but crucial improvement in the reordering for word alignment method proposed in (Carpuat et al.,
2010). This method attempts to make Arabic and English word order closer to each other by reordering
Arabic VS constructions into SV during word alignment. However, as we have seen in Section 4, auto-
matic detection of subject boundaries is very noisy, so we adopt a conservative reordering strategy and
only reorder Arabic sentences to perform word alignment. Unlike most syntactically motivated reordering
models (e.g., Collins et al. (2005); Habash (2007)), our system performs phrase-translation extraction and
decoding on the original Arabic word order. Reordering Arabic VS attempts to make the bitext easier to
explain by the alignment model, and should therefore help generate accurate links between Arabic and
English words. Limiting reordering to alignment prevents the system from learning translation rules on
incorrect word orders introduced either by incorrect VS detection, or by incorrect reordering of a correctly
detected VS
To sum up, given a parallel sentence (a, e), we proceed as follows :
1.   automatically tag VS constructions in a
2.   generate new sentence a = reorder(a) by reordering matrix VSs into SVs.
3.   get word alignment wa on new sentence pair (a , e) :
4.   using mapping from a to a = reorder(a), get corresponding word alignment wa = unreorder(wa )
for the original sentence pair (a, e)

6        SMT evaluation set-up
We use the open-source Moses toolkit (Koehn et al., 2007) to build two phrase-based SMT systems trained
on two different data conditions :
1. medium-scale the bitext consists of 12M words on the Arabic side (LDC2007E103). The language
model is trained on the English side of the large bitext.
2. large-scale the bitext consists of several newswire LDC corpora, and has 64M words on the Arabic
side. The language model is trained on the English side of the bitext augmented with Gigaword data.
For both systems, the parallel corpus is word-aligned using the GIZA++ (Och & Ney, 2003), which se-
quentially learns word alignments for the IBM1, HMM, IBM3 and IBM4 models. The resulting align-
ments in both translation directions are intersected and augmented using the grow-diag-final-and heuristic
(Koehn et al., 2007). Phrase translations of up to 10 words are extracted in the Moses phrase-table, and
filtered using statistical significance testing (Johnson et al., 2007).We use a 5-gram language model with
modified Kneser-Ney smoothing. Feature weights are tuned to maximize BLEU on the NIST MT06 test
set.The English data is tokenized using simple punctuation-based rules. The Arabic side is segmented
according to the Arabic Treebank v3.1 tokenization scheme using the MADA+TOKAN morphological
analyzer and tokenizer (Habash & Rambow, 2005). MADA-produced Arabic lemmas are used for word
alignment. The dependency parser described in Section 4 is applied to the entire Arabic training data.

7        Matrix VS reordering significantly improves BLEU and TER
On a large test set of more than 4440 sentences, reordering matrix VS remarkably yields statistically
significant improvements in BLEU (Papineni et al., 2002) and TER (Snover et al., 2006) over both baseline
SMT systems at the 99% confidence level (Table 3). In addition, restricting reordering to matrix VS also
yields better scores than reordering all VS constructions (as in Carpuat et al. (2010)). Results per test set

are reported in Table 4. It is worth noting that consistent improvements are obtained even on the large-scale
system, and that both medium and large-scale baselines are strong full-fledged systems with distortion and
lexicalized reordering models, as well as large 5-gram language models.

More analysis is needed to better understand how the gains in BLEU and TER relate to the changes
in word alignment introduced by matrix VS reordering. Previous work showed that intrinsic evaluation
of word alignment quality against manually created references does not correlate well with translation
quality (see (Lopez & Resnik, 2006) for an overview.) Since we are primarily interested in the end-goal
of improving translation (rather than alignment), we do not compute alignment error rates against manual
word alignments. Instead, we use baseline word alignments learned on a much larger training set as a basis
for comparison. We argue that these alignments can be used as a valid reference despite being learned
automatically, since, unlike gold manual alignments, they do improve translation quality in an end-to-end
SMT system.
We therefore build a fourth medium-scale system using word alignment models trained on the large-
scale bitext, which is more than 5 times larger than the medium-scale bitext. The SMT system is trained
using these improved alignment links for the subset of the large bitext that matches the medium-scale
data condition. This system improves the medium-scale baseline by +1.37 BLEU and -1.6 TER on the
concatenated test sets. Comparing these improvements in BLEU and TER with those obtained in Table 3
shows that the gains obtained with VS reordering are quite significant : without using any additional SMT
training data, our matrix VS reordering technique interestingly yields 44% of the gain in BLEU and 51%
of the gain in TER obtained with a word alignment training bitext that is 5 times larger.
Finally, we compare the word alignment links learned by the different versions of the system on a com-
mon sample of about 15k sentence pairs. Table 5 shows that reordering matrix VS yields slightly fewer

alignment links than both the baseline and the system that reordered all VS. Columns 3-5 show that the
word alignments learned with reordered matrix VS are quite different from all others : only 43% of these
links are also learned by the baseline system, while more than 75% of the baseline links are covered with
VS matrix reordering. Finally, Column 6 reveals that the matrix VS reordering strategy yields the highest
percentage of common links with the improved alignments learned on the large-scale bitext.

To the best of our knowledge, the only other approach to detecting and using Arabic verb-subject (VS)
constructions for SMT is that of Green et al. (2009), which failed to improve Arabic-English SMT. Instead
of directly modeling VS reordering, subject span information was used to encourage a phrase-based SMT
decoder to use phrasal translations that do not break subject boundaries. Matrix and non-matrix subjects
were not treated differently. In addition, their VS detection model is very different from ours, since it
bypasses full syntactic parsing, but similarly produces noisy subject boundaries, especially at the “right
edge”. They report 65.9% precision and 61.3% F-score only detecting maximal (non-nested) subjects of
verb-initial clauses (most comparable to our VS condition) using a different training / test split of the
PATB (parts 1, 2 and 3) data. Both approaches use simplified POS tags, and various linguistic relations,
such as the N-N construct (Idafa). However, while they use a generally flat (non-hierarchical) notation,
trained with conditional random fields (CRF), we rely on hierarchical representations from dependency
parsing, allowing us coverage of non-maximal subjects as well, in addition to matricity identification.
Syntactically motivated reordering for phrase-based SMT has been more successful on other language
pairs than Arabic-English, perhaps due to more accurate parsers and less ambiguous reordering patterns
than for Arabic VS. For instance, Collins et al. (2005) apply six manually defined transformations to
German parse trees which yield an improvement of 0.4 BLEU on the Europarl German-English translation
task. Xia & McCord (2004) learn reordering rules for French to English translations, which arguably
presents less syntactic distortion than Arabic-English. Zhang et al. (2007) limit reordering to decoding for
Chinese-English SMT using a lattice representation. Cherry (2008) uses dependency parses as cohesion
constraints in decoding for French-English SMT.
For Arabic-English phrase-based SMT, the impact of syntactic reordering as preprocessing is less clear.
Habash (2007) shows that syntactic reordering rules targeting Arabic-English word order differences help
BLEU compared to phrase-based SMT limited to monotonic decoding, but improvements do not hold with
distortion. Learning reordering rules has given positive results when using POS and shallow syntax in a
ngram-based SMT system(Crego & Habash, 2008).
Most previous syntax-aware word alignment models were specifically designed for syntax-based SMT
systems. These models are often bootstrapped from existing word alignments, and could therefore benefit
from our VS reordering approach. For instance, Fossum et al. (2008), report improvements ranging from
R EORDERING M ATRIX P OST- VERBAL S UBJECTS FOR A RABIC - TO -E NGLISH SMT

0.1 to 0.5 BLEU on Arabic translation by learning to delete alignment links if they degrade their syntax-
based translation system. Departing from commonly-used alignment strategies, Hermjakob (2009) aligns
Arabic and English content words using pointwise mutual information, and in this process indirectly uses
English sentences reordered into VS order to collect cooccurrence counts. The approach outperforms
GIZA++ on a small scale translation task, but the impact of reordering alone is not evaluated.

9    Conclusion
We showed that matrix VS constructions deserve special attention in Arabic-to-English translation. While
most matrix VS constructions are translated in inverted order (SV), non-matrix (subordinate clause) VS
constructions are inverted in only half the cases. This suggest that it is not advisable to work under the
naïve assumption that all Arabic VS constructions should be translated to English SV. Based on this
observation, we refine the reordering rule applied to word alignments in (Carpuat et al., 2010) with a
simple but crucial change : instead of reordering all Arabic VS constructions, we limit reordering to
matrix VS. This approach remarkably improves the translation quality of strong medium- and large-scale
phrase-based SMT systems, despite using noisy matrix VS predictions. The improvements obtained by
reordering matrix VS on the medium-scale setting represent 44% of the gain in BLEU and 51% of the
gain in TER obtained with a word alignment training bitext that is 5 times larger.
