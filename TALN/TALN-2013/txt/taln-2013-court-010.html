<p>ABSTRACT
This article presents supervised computational methods for the identification of Spanish
varieties. The features used for this task were the classical character and word n-gram
language models as well as POS and morphological information. The use of these features is
to our knowledge new and we aim to explore the extent to which it is possible to identify
language varieties solely based on grammatical differences. Four journalistic corpora from
different countries were used in these experiments : Spain, Argentina, Mexico and Peru.

<p>1 Introduction
</p>
<p>Spanish is a world language with official status in 21 countries. It is regarded to be a Pluri-
centric language with a number of interacting centres and language varieties (Thompson,
1992). Each of these national varieties has their own characteristics in terms of phonetics,
lexicon and syntax.
</p>
<p>Computational applications can benefit from identifying the correct variety of Spanish texts
when undertaking tasks such as Machine Translation or Information Extraction, as they are
able to handle lexical, orthographic and syntactic variation more accurately. The task is
modelled as a classification problem with very similar methods to those applied to general

</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, very few attempts have been made to address the problem of
identifying language varieties as evidenced in 2.1. In this work we try to classify texts retrieved
from newspapers published in 2008 from four different Spanish speaking countries : Spain,
Argentina, Mexico and Peru. Moreover, we propose the use of new features, not limited to the
classical word and character n-grams. We experimented features based on POS distribution
and morphosyntactic information. The use of knowledge-rich features is not an attempt to
outperform word and character n-gram-based methods, but an attempt to examine the extent
to which these varieties differ in terms of grammar.
</p>
<p>2 Related Work
</p>
<p>Language identification is the task of automatically identifying the language contained in a
given document. State-of-the-art methods apply n-gram language models at the character
and sometimes word-level with results usually above 95% accuracy. This level of success is
very common when dealing with languages which are typologically not closely related. This
is however not the case of language varieties in which the distinction is based on very subtle
differences that algorithms can be trained to recognize.
</p>
<p>One of the first general purpose language identification approaches was the work of Ingle
(1980). Ingle applied Zipf&#8217;s law distribution to order the frequency of stop words in a text
and used this information for language identification. Dunning (1994) introduced the use of
character n-grams and statistics for language identification. In this study, the likelihood of n-
grams was calculated using Markov models and this was used as the most informative feature
for identification. Other studies applying n-gram language models for language identification
include Cavnar and Trenkle (1994) implemented as TextCat 1, Grefenstette (1995), and Vojtek
and Belikova (2007).
</p>
<p>In the recent years, a number of language identification methods were developed for internet
data such as Martins and Silva (2005) and Rehurek and Kolkus (2009). The most recent
general purpose language identification method to our knowledge is the one published by Lui
and Baldwin (2012). Their software, called langid.py, has language models for 97 languages,
using various data sources. The method achieved results of up to 94.7% accuracy, thus
outperforming similar tools. All models described in this section neglect language varieties.
Pluricentric languages, such as the case of Spanish, are represented by a unique class.
</p>
<p>2.1 Models for Similar Languages, Varieties and Dialects
</p>
<p>The identification of closely related languages is one of the bottlenecks of most n-gram-based
models and there are only a few studies published about it. Ljube&#353;ic&#769; et al. (2007) propose a
computational model for the identification of Croatian texts in comparison to other South
Slavic languages reporting 99% recall and precision in three processing stages. One of these
processing stages, includes a so-called black list, a list of forbidden words that appear only in

</p>
<p>Ranaivo-Malancon (2006) presents a semi-supervised character-based model to distinguish
between Indonesian and Malay, two closely related languages from the Austronesian family
and Huang and Lee (2008) proposes a bag-of-words approach to distinguish Chinese texts
from Mainland and Taiwan reporting results of up to 92% accuracy. More recently, Trieschnigg
et al. Trieschnigg et al. (2012) described classification experiments for a set of sixteen Dutch
dialects using the Dutch Folktale Database.
</p>
<p>For romance languages, the DEFT2010 2 shared task aimed to classify French journalistic
texts not only with respect to their geographical location but also incorporating a temporal
dimension. For Portuguese, Zampieri and Gebre (2012) proposed a log-likelihood estimation
method to distinguish between European and Brazilian Portuguese texts with results above
99.5% for character n-grams. The model was later applied to a multilingual setting with
French and Spanish texts (Zampieri et al., 2012).
</p>
<p>3 Methods
</p>
<p>We collected four comparable corpora to use in our experiments, one for each language
variety. To collect comparable samples, we retrieved texts published in the same year from
local newspapers regarded to have similar register, as follows :
</p>
<p>Country Newspaper Year
Argentina La Naci&#243;n 2008
Mexico El Universal 2008
Peru El Com&#233;rcio 2008
Spain El Mundo 2008
</p>
<p>TABLE 1 &#8211; Corpora
</p>
<p>Each sub-corpus contains a set of 1,000 documents randomly sampled to avoid bias towards
a given topic or genre. These sub-corpora were divided in training and test settings of 500
documents each. Following the compilation of the corpora, four groups of features were
selected. The list of features used and the aspect of language that these features aim to analyse
are presented next :
</p>
<p>&#8211; Character n-grams (2 to 5) : orthography and lexicon
&#8211; Word uni-grams : lexicon
&#8211; Word bi-grams : lexicon and syntax
&#8211; POS and morphological features : morphology and syntax
</p>
<p>The first three groups of features (knowledge-poor features) are standard in language iden-
tification and they were widely used in previous approaches. The fourth group of features
(knowledge-rich features) is to our knowledge new and it consists of the use of POS and
morphological feature annotation. The POS tags and morphological information were used
as one unit in form of a compound tags (e.g. N-msc-sg or V-inf).
</p>
<p>A snapshot of the tagset with nouns, adjectives and verbs is presented in table 2.

<p>TABLE 2 &#8211; Tagset
</p>
<p>Although research in language identification and text classification shows that character
and word n-gram-based methods outperform knowledge-rich features, we believe that these
features are still worth experimenting with. Firstly, from an NLP perspective, these new
features model a different aspect of language that cannot be addressed by neither character
nor word n-grams. Secondly, because the average results obtained and the corresponding
most informative features might be an important resource for contrastive linguistics providing
an indication of how varieties converge and diverge.
</p>
<p>The classification method is based on n-gram language models and document log-likelihood
estimation (Dunning, 1993) as described in Zampieri and Gebre (2012). Its performance
is comparable to state-of-the-art methods in language identification which focus on similar
languages. It was tested on Bosnian, Croatian and Serbian documents 3 achieving 91.0%
accuracy. Models described in Ljube&#353;ic&#769; et al. (2007) achieved 90.3% and 95.7% accuracy
using the same dataset.
</p>
<p>The method calculates language models using Laplace probability distribution for smoothing
and after this calculation computes the probability of each document to belong to a certain
class using a log-likelihood function as shown in equation 1.
</p>
<p>P(L|tex t) = argmax
L
</p>
<p>N&#65535;
i=1
</p>
<p>log P(ni |L) + log P(L) (1)
</p>
<p>N is the number of n-grams in the test text, ni is the ith n-gram and L stands for the language
models. Given a test text, we calculate the probability for each of the language models. The
language model with higher probability determines the identified language of the text.
</p>
<p>4 Results
</p>
<p>The first experiments used knowledge-poor features to classify the four Spanish varieties
evaluated using precision (P), recall (R) and f-measure (F). Results ranged from 0.813 f-
measure for character 4-grams to 0.876 f-measure for word bi-grams. The results for each
class remained constant for all features and this can be seen in table 3.

</p>
<p>The best results were obtained for the classification of texts from Argentina and Mexico
reaching 0.999 average accuracy. As the confusion matrix in 4 indicated, the worst setting
was again Spain x Argentina with an average result of 0.842 accuracy. All the results obtained
were substantially higher than the 4-class classification setting. As classification algorithms
tend to perform better in binary settings, this was an expected outcome.

<p>Next we present the results obtained using POS distribution and morphological features,
combined in sets of 2, 3 and 4 compound tags as explained in section 3. The classification

nations of two tags. These two varieties also obtained satisfactory scores for character and

</p>
<p>TABLE 6 &#8211; Classification with POS Tags
</p>
<p>The poorest results were obtained once again in the classification of Spanish and Argentinian
texts, which also obtained the worst performance using knowledge-poor features. Even though
the results are lower than those obtained using knowledge-poor features, the algorithm scored
better than the expected 0.50 baseline, indicating that it is able to identify patterns in the
datasets using only sets of morphosyntactical information. Named entities which usually help
algorithms to identify varieties at the lexical level are not present in the experiments using
POS tags and therefore do not influence the performance of the classifier.
</p>
<p>4.2 Relationship Between Features
</p>
<p>To evaluate the relationship between the features explored here, we analysed results using
hierarchical clustering. For each cluster, two p-values (between 0 and 1) are calculated via
multiscale bootstrap resampling. These values indicate how strong the cluster is supported by
data. The two p-values are : the AU (Approximately Unbiased), in red, computed by multiscale
bootstrap resampling and BP (Bootstrap Probability) in green, computed by normal bootstrap
resampling. The graphic shows the difference between the performance of knowledge-poor
and knowledge-rich features, arranging each in a different cluster 1.
</p>
<p>FIGURE 1 &#8211; Cluster Dendogram with AU/BP Values
</p>
<p>The analysis grouped the two word-based feature groups in the same cluster, as they performed
on average better than the character-based methods. Another interesting point of the analysis
is that the results of character 4- and 5-grams are grouped in the same cluster due to an

</div></div>
<div style="page-break-before:always; page-break-after:always"><div><p>increase in performance when a larger amount of characters are taken into account. Character
4- and 5-grams features are closer to the lexical level taking whole words into account, which
suggests that the model is more effective when using complete lexical items as features.
</p>
<p>As stated before, the morphological features were not expected to outperform the knowledge-
poor models, but to be used to investigate differences in grammar. An interesting outcome
of these experiments is the direct relationship between the algorithm&#8217;s performance using
knowledge-poor and knowledge-rich features. One clear example is the classification of
Argentina and Spain which obtained the worst results with characters and words as well as
when using POS and morphology : 0.843 and 0.666 accuracy respectively. Another example
is Argentina and Mexico which achieved the best results using characters and words, 0.999
accuracy and the second best results with POS tags, 0.801 accuracy.
</p>
<p>For these reasons, the results presented here are an encouraging perspective for further
studies. It is possible to use the outcome of the classification as a source of information for
contrastive linguistics to provide quantitative overview on how these varieties converge and
diverge in terms of grammar and lexicon. Linguistic analysis may be carried out using the
most informative features in classification.
</p>
<p>5 Conclusion and Future Perspectives
</p>
<p>We presented a first attempt to identify a set of four Spanish varieties in written texts with
f-measure results ranging from 0.813 to 0.876. As expected, the binary classification settings
have achieved significantly better results in comparison to the 4-class classification setting.
The algorithm was able to distinguish between texts from Argentina and Mexico with an
average accuracy of 0.999. As previously discussed, the integration of these language models
in real-world NLP applications, should improve results in a number of NLP tasks.
</p>
<p>The experiments used not only the classical character and word n-gram models but also
morphosyntactic information combined with POS. This is to our knowledge a new contribution
of our work to this kind of experiments. The classification with knowledge-rich features
achieved up to 0.831 accuracy for Mexican and Peninsular Spanish. We observed a direct
relationship between the performance of knowledge-poor and knowledge-rich features, binary
settings which obtained good performance using characters and words also present good
results using morphosyntactic information. This aspect should be better explored in future
work through a careful linguistic analysis.
</p>
<p>As future perspectives, first we wish to compare the performance of our method with general
purpose language identification methods such as langid.py (Lui and Baldwin, 2012). Second,
we are replicating our experiments to a set of French varieties. Finally, we would like to
experiment the combination of POS and word n-grams to investigate if performance increases.
