RÉSUMÉ _______________________________________________________________________________________________________  
Au cours des deux dernières décennies des psychologues et des linguistes informaticiens 
ont essayé de modéliser l'accès lexical en construisant des simulations ou des ressources. 
Cependant, parmi ces chercheurs, pratiquement personne n'a vraiment cherché à 
améliorer la navigation dans des 'dictionnaires électroniques destinés aux producteurs 
de langue'. Pourtant, beaucoup de travaux ont été consacrés à l'étude du phénomène du 
mot sur le bout de la langue et à la construction de réseaux lexicaux. Par ailleurs, vu les 
progrès réalisés en neurosciences et dans le domaine des réseaux complexes, on pourrait 
être tenté de construire un simulacre du dictionnaire mental, ou, à défaut une ressource 
destinée aux producteurs de langue (écrivains, conférenciers). Nous sommes restreints 
en construisant un réseau de co-occurrences à partir des résumés de Wikipedia, le but 
étant de vérifier jusqu'où l'on pouvait pousser une telle ressource pour trouver un mot, 
sachant que la ressource ne contient pas de liens sémantiques, car le réseau est construit 
de manière automatique et à partir de textes non-annotés. 
ABSTRACT _____________________________________________________________________________________________________  
During the last two decades psychologists and computational linguists have attempted 
to tackle the problem of word access via computational resources, yet hardly none of 
them has seriously tried to support 'interactive' word finding. Yet, a lot of work has been 
done to understand the causes of the tip-of-the-tongue problem (TOT). Given the 
progress made in neuroscience, corpus linguistics, and graph theory (complex graphs), 
one may be tempted to emulate the mental lexicon, or to build a resource likely to help 
authors (speakers, writers) to overcome word-finding problems. Our goal here is much 
more limited. We try to identify good hints for finding a target word. To this end we 
have built a co-occurrence network on the basis of Wikipedia abstracts. Since the 
network is built automatically and from raw data, i.e. non-annotated text, it does not 
reveal the kind of relationship holding between the nodes. Despite this shortcoming we 
tried to see whether we can find a given word, or, to identify what is a good clue word.

Lexical choice is an obligatory step in language production. During this stage, the

author (speaker or writer) has to select a word expressing the concept or idea he/she 
has in mind. Of course, before choosing a word, one must have accessed a set of words 
from which to choose. While writers may use an external resource (dictionary) in case 
of word finding problems, speakers always rely on the internal or mental lexicon 
(human brain) which is known for its remarkable organisation. It is still a matter of 
debate where and in what form words are stored in the brain, yet, there is a general 
belief concerning dictionaries, namely: the bigger (the more entries), the better. While 
making sense from a practical point of view, this statement may nevertheless be 
misleading. Storage does not imply accessibility. This is well known via the ‘tip of the 
tongue’-problem (TOT, Brown & McNeill, 1996; Brown, 1991)2, but this holds also for 
electronic resources. For example,, variations of the input (query) or variations 
concerning the principle underlying the building of the resource may affect considerably 
the success of finding a given target word (Zock & Schwab, 2013). While authors need 
dictionaries, the latter are only truly useful if the words they contain are easily 
accessible. To allow for this we need good indexes (Zock & Schwab, 2013). 
Lexical access has been widely studied and modelled by psychologists (Dell, 1986; 
Levelt et al. 1999). However, none of this work addresses the problem of word finding 
via an electronic resource. The work done by computational lexicographers is generally 
based on the readers' needs: words are listed alphabetically, and little if any provision is 
made to allow for conceptual input. Indeed, what kind of information (query, 
conceptual input) should a user give if the target words are ‘avatar’, ‘tiara’ or 
‘eschatology’? While there are many kinds of dictionaries, only very few of them are 
really helpful for the writer or speaker. Still, great efforts have been made to improve 
the situation. In fact, there are quite a few onomasiological dictionaries, like Roget’s 
Thesaurus (Roget, 1852), and various network-based dictionaries, with WordNet 
(Fellbaum, 1998; Miller et al., 1990) being the best known. There are also various 
collocation dictionaries (BBI, OECD), reverse dictionaries (Edmonds, 1999, or 
Wordsmyth, www.wordsmyth.net) and OneLook, which combines a dictionary 
(WordNet) and an encyclopedia (Wikipedia). Finally, there is MEDAL (Rundell and Fox, 
2002), a thesaurus produced with the help of Kilgariff’s Sketch Engine (Kilgarriff et al., 
2004). 
Despite its shortcomings, of all these proposals WordNet (WN) clearly stands out. While 
being built manually, it embodies a number of features known from the mental lexicon: 
the lexicon is a multidimensional network whose nodes (words) are linked via various 
kinds of relations. WNs have been built for many languages 
(http://www.globalwordnet.org), and the initial resource has been adapted and 
improved, to yield eXtendedWN, (Mihalcea et Moldovan, 2001) an application able to 
support a great number of tasks in NLP. 
Other networks have been built differently. For example, JeuxDeMot (JdM, Lafourcade, 
2007) was built via a huge community (crowdsourcing) playing games. The approach is 
similar to other web-based resources, like Open Mind Word Expert (Mihalcea et 
                                                   
2 The TOT-problem consists in the fact that an author knows a word, but is occasionally unable to access it. 
Typically, he has activated most of the target's features, but fails to retrieve some of the crucial, final, sound 
related fragments. This is why the speaker has the impression that the word has nearly made it, but not quite. 
The word is stuck on the tip of the tongue.

Chklovski, 2003) and SemKey (Marchetti et al., 2007). JdM is coupled with AKI 
(Joubert et Lafourcade, 2012), which is supposed to allow for word access. To what 
extend this is truly so remains an empirical question, despite the fact that the initial 
results look quite promising (Joubert et al. 2011). 
Zock et al. (2010) propose an association-based index to support interactive lexical 
access for language producers. To this end they suggest to build a matrix on the basis of 
co-occurrences. Put differently, they try to capture word associations and the links 
holding between them. This approach seems attractive as the network is built 
automatically, corpus-based, computer-supported, and the resource allows for graph-
based analysis (relative distance, clustering effects, etc.). However, this work is also 
confronted with some unsolved problems like disambiguation of the input (query, clue), 
explicitation of the link type and clustering of the output (the answers given in response 
to a query). Usability will be hampered as long as all this cannot be done automatically. 
We try to tackle a similar problem, but we do not address interactive search, but only 
automatic access. More precisely, we try to address the tip-of-the-tongue problem by 
using a graph-kind of approach. Overall, the following ideas underlie this work: 
a) usage of an non-annotated source, containing a large number of words; 
b) structuring of the lexicon in the simplest way possible, i.e. by relying only graph 
theory and statistics; 
c) exclusive usage of co-occurrences for building the graph. Semantic relations are 
ignored at this stage;  
d) exclusive reliance on automatic processing (hence, no manual annotations); 
e) conception of very simple graph search algorithms. 
The approach is extremely simple. We use co-occurrences because it is a straightforward 
way to structure words on the basis of weights, i.e. numerical values. We do not claim 
any cognitive relevance other than statistics, which seem nevertheless to work when 
modelling language production (Levelt et al. 1999). 
2  Co-occurrence network 
Our goal is to build a co-occurrence graph able to achieve similar results to the ones of 
annotated systems. To achieve this goal, we decided to start with a large, non-annotated 
corpus: the entire set of Wikipedia's abstracts, i.e. almost 4 million documents. To build 
the graph our system runs through a pipeline of five modules: 
1. document cleaning (deletion of stop-words); 
2. parsing of the abstracts and extraction of ‘Nouns’ and ‘Adjectives’; 
3. lemmatisation of word forms to avoid duplicates (horse, horses); 
4. computation of the (un-directed) graph's nodes. Links are created between 
direct neighbours; 
5. computation of the edges’ weights. The weight of an edge is equal to the 
number of its occurrences. We only use absolute values. 
 
Performing the above described operations yields a graph of 1.595.133 (different) 
nodes, of which nearly half (48%, i.e. 765.081) are happaxes, that is, terms occurring 
only once within the source. In order to understand the reason for this, one must take 
598 ￿c ATALA
TALN-RÉCITAL 2013, 17-21 Juin, Les Sables d’Olonne
into account the nature of the resource, and the nature of the words used.  
Since our source is an encyclopaedia, it contains an unusually high number of terms 
related to science, history, peoples' names or names of geographical locations, concepts 
from other languages... Concerning the extracted words, it should be noted that only 
nouns and adjectives were used. The deletion of verbs and adverbs is motivated by 
practical considerations: decreasing the size of the network alleviates processing. Put 
differently, our choice has been made only for this specific experiment. We wanted to 
focus only on nouns and adjectives, maintaining them even if their weights are very 
low. Stop words have been also eliminated, but for a different reason. They are hardly 
ever used as ‘clues’, and using them nevertheless may bias the results. Finally, we get a 
weighted list of nodes.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
FIGURE 1 – Weights of the nodes of the graph 
Figure 1 shows the distribution of frequencies. The weight of most nodes is below 10, 
speaking in absolute terms. Yet, 86 words are solid hubs with more than 100000 
occurrences. Here are the 20 nodes with the greatest weight:  
[(State, 502915), (Born, 424243), (New, 349236), (County, 348655), (District, 344620), 
(First, 339583), (American, 330643), (United, 320260), (School, 280589), (Village, 
277337), (City, 276718), (Album, 272357), (Film, 260753), (National, 251727), (Family, 
247912), (University, 239137), (Year, 238700), (South, 236760), (Part, 231373), (Football, 
224046)] 
Note, that the weight of more than 2/3 of edges is 1, the weight of the remaining third 
is >1, the proportion being 69/31. Moreover, there is only one edge with a value 
greater than 100000, state-united, i.e. ‘United States’, the most frequently mentioned co-
occurrence in the Wikipedia abstracts. The weight of the following edges exceeds 
30000:  
[(State United, 152347), (High School, 70053), (New York, 66052), (War World, 59523), 
(Administrative District, 58113), (Census Population, 55299), (District Gmina, 51501), 
(Administrative Village, 46922), (New Zealand, 44320), (Football League, 42994), (Kingdom 
United, 39798), (Album Studio, 36887), (Olympics Summer, 34421), (Ii War, 33800), (Railway 
Station, 33723), (Capital Regional, '3300)]

The distribution of edges' weights is shown in Figure 2. Data whose value is 1 are 
omitted in the figure. 
FIGURE 2 – Weights of the edges of the graph 
3  Search algorithm 
The search of the target word T in a graph G, is done via some clues, say c1, c2, c3, 
(mouse, Prolog, Java, in figure 3) which act as inputs. G=(V, E) stands for the graph, 
with V expressing the set of vertices and E the set of edges. The clues c1, c2, c3 ѮV. N(i) 
expresses the neighbourhood of a node (i ѮV) and is defined as 'every jѮV | ei,j ѮE. The 
search algorithm is as follows:  
• Define the neighbourhood of c1, c2, c3, N(c1), N(c2), N(c3);  
• Get the set of nodes VT = N(c1) ҏ N(c2) ҏ N(c3) and consider Vc={c1, c2, c3} to 
be the set of nodes representing the clues. We define a subgraph of G, GT, that is 
a complete bipartite graph, where every element of VT is connected to every 
element of Vc; 
• Rank the nodes of VT according to their strength (s) in GT. For every v in VT, sv 
=1/3 (w(vc1)+ w(vc2)+ w(vc2)). 
4  Performance 
Taking random examples, the system's capacity to find words is remarkably good, 
provided that all the clues are from the same domain. Otherwise performance may 
degrade: compare (a1, b1) and b2. In the first two cases the target appears on top of the 
list, whereas in b-2 the target word gets demoted to the 13th position. Being from a 
different domain, the clue ‘India’ impedes performance. On the other hand, widening 
the clues' semantic scope has as a positive effect, see c1, c2.

FIGURE 3A – Graph GT for (tusk, trunk, ear) 3B –GT for (mouse, Prolog, Java) 
a) Target: ‘hand’:  
– The clues ‘finger’, ‘wrist’, ‘glove’, yield 9 hits, displaying the target in the 
first position: 1 (hand, 153); 2 (right, 29); 3 (arm, 25); 4 (part, 24); 5 (first, 
21); 6 (side, 18); 7 (worn, 17); 8 (person, 12); 9 (game, 8).  
b) Target: ‘elephant’:  
1. By entering the words ‘tusk’, ‘trunk’, ‘ear’ (figure 3a), we get a list 
of 14 items of which the first 10 are as follows: 1 (elephant), 51; 2 (upper), 
28; 3 (species, 28); 4 (single, 25); 5 (lower, 24); 6 (small, 23); 7 (album, 
22); 8 (large, 19); 9 (name, 18); 10 (side, 17). 
2. If we provide ‘tusk’, ‘trunk’, ‘India’, we get the target in the 13th 
position, right after ‘first’, ‘year’, ‘country’, ‘name’, ‘member’, ‘species’, 
‘born’, ‘family’, ‘small’, ‘large’, ‘long’, ‘upper’, ‘elephant’. 
c) Target: ‘computer’:  
1. The clues ‘mouse’, ‘keyboard’, ‘screen’ produce a large number of hits. 
The program displays only the first fifty. 1 (player, 600); 2 (computer, 264); 3 
(first, 192); 4 (appearance, 191); 5 (name, 178); 6 (album, 99); 7 (small, 90); 
8 (role, 89); 9 (music, 89); 10 (band, 82). 
2. The clues ‘mouse’, ‘Prolog’ and ‘Java’ (figure 3-b) produce only four 
hits: 1 (program, 58); 2 (computer, 47); 3 (development, 31); 4 (book, 16) 
The given examples could make us believe that the program works quite well. While 
being true, this is not always the case. For example, when we tried the examples used 
by (Zock et Schwab, 2011), namely, ‘wine’, ‘harvest’, ‘grape’, the system was unable to 
find the target word ‘vintage’. On the other hand, by changing slightly the input, 
providing ‘vintage’, ‘harvest’, and ‘grape’, we did get ‘wine’ in the first position and with 
a very strong score (735). This suggests both a conclusion and a question: (a) the 
601 ￿c ATALA
TALN-RÉCITAL 2013, 17-21 Juin, Les Sables d’Olonne
algorithm is not yet good enough, since it works in some cases, but not in others; (b) 
since some terms are definitely better triggers or cues than others, we may wonder what 
are good cue words, and to this end we could use this resource in order to answer this 
question empirically. This is a possibility we are currently exploring. 
 
5  Conclusions 
Experiments done with the resource built on the basis of the co-occurrences extracted 
from Wikipedia shows that it allows for accessing words. It also shows, if ever 
necessary, that not all words are equally good as inputs. This being so, we could use this 
resource as a workbenchto find out empirically which words, or which specific kind of 
words are good inputs for a given target word.  
While there is little doubt that Wikipedia is a quite useful source, it does also have its 
shortcomings. For example, it does not contain episodic knowledge (information 
concerning current events, anecdotes,...), hence, it may be good to consider other types 
of texts containing more common words (authentic exchanges between people).  
Concerning the system's performance one may conclude that it is quite good, but we 
should bear in mind that we dealt with automatic access and not interactive word 
finding. While the number of hits is (within limits) of little importance in the former 
case —(computers will find quickly a word even in a huge list, say, a list of 3000 
tokens),— it becomes a critical issue in the latter case. This is why typing the links, or 
clustering the output is an important component for supporting interactive word search. 
This being said, getting a clearer picture concerning clues may still be of interest for 
those interested in designing tools to support word access.
