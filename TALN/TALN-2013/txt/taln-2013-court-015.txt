ABSTRACT

Arabic is a morphologically rich and complex language, which presents signiﬁcant
challenges for natural language processing and machine translation. In this paper, we
describe an ongoing effort to build a competitive Arabic-French phrase—based machine
translation system using the Moses decoder and other tools.

The results show an increase in terms of BLEU score after introducing some pre-processing
schemes for Arabic and applying additional language analysis rules in relation to the target
language. The proposed approach is completed using pre-processing and language analysis
rules without increasing the amount of training data.

inﬂections but also clitics, such as pronouns, conjunctions, and prepositions. This
morphological complexity also has consequences for NLP applications, such as machine
translation and information retrieval. On the one hand, developing an Arabic-French
machine translation system is not an easy task, although there is a vast amount of training
data nowadays. On the other hand, dealing with the complexity and ambiguity of the source
language plays a major role in boosting the efﬁciency of the translation system.

In previous research, it was shown that morphological pre-processing of a morphologically
rich language, such as Arabic does provide a beneﬁt, especially in the case of limited volume
of training data (Goldwater and McClosky, 2005 ; Sadat and Habash, 2006 ; Lee, 2004 ; El
Ishibani et al., 2006 ; Hasan et al., 2003).

In Statistical Machine Translation (SMT) context, Habash et Sadat (2006) pre-processed
Arabic texts using different segmentation schemes for translation into English and showed
that the quality of translation is generally better than the baseline. Similar findings were
reported by El Ishibani et al. (2006) on Arabic-English SMT.

In relation to Arabic-French SMT, few research and evaluations were reported, compared to
Arabic-English SMT among other pairs of languages. One of the first statistically-driven
machine translation systems for Arabic-French was reported by Hasan et al (Hasan et al.,
2006) during the second Cesta evaluation campaign1. The proposed SMT system used a
simple stemming algorithm based on finite-state automata to split Arabic words into
preﬁxes, stem and sufﬁxes. Nevertheless, this simple segmentation method showed a
reduced OOV rate from 8.2% to 2.6% for the test data and thus a better quality of
translation in terms of BLEU score (Papineni et al., 2001). Another research on Arabic-
French SMT was focused on domain adaptation to the news domain and did not consider
the pre-processing of the morphologically complex language such as Arabic (Schwenk and
Senellart, 2009). An improvement of 3.5 BLEU points on the test set was realized.

In relation to improving an SMT system using some language analysis rules, such as re-
ordering with Arabic as a source language, there was no reported research on Arabic-
French SMT. However, Carpuat et al. (Carpuat et al., 2010) showed that post-verbal subject
(VS) constructions are hard to translate because they have highly ambiguous reordering
patterns when translated to English. They proposed to reorder VS construction into SV
order for SMT word alignment only. This strategy signiﬁcantly improves BLEU and TER
scores of the SMT using Arabic and English language pair.

In this paper, we report some experiments related to our ﬁrst participation in the 2012
TRAD evaluation campaign 2, that was coordinated by the Laboratoire National de
me’tro1og1'e et d’Essa1's (LNE) and CASSIDIAN (the defence and security subsidiary of the
EADS group), and was funded by the French General Directorate for Armament (DGA). Our
main interest at this stage is related to the pre-processing of the source language, in order
to improve the quality of translation, rather than the radical changes that might improve
the translation or training engines or the increase of the amount of training corpora.

This paper is organized as follows. The morphology of Arabic language is described in
section 2. In section 3, we discuss the proposed solutions of pre-processing Arabic through

segmentation and language analysis. In section 4-, we present the experiments on Arabic-
French SMT with different evaluations. Section 5 concludes the present paper with a
discussion and some perspectives.

a The Morphology of Arabic Language

Before we delve into the methods, we need to discuss the nature of the Arabic language,
which has a bearing on the text preparation stage. Figure 1 shows a white-space delimited
word in Arabic.

The Arabic script is complicated in that each white-space-delimited unit may correspond to
several syntactic units. The Arabic orthographic unit, a unit delimited by white space,
usually carries more than one token. An example is a form like (wsyktbWnhA)3 (Eng. and
they will write it, depicted in Figure 1.). This grammatically complete sentence carries a
conjunction w, a future particle s, a verbal token yktbwn, and a feminine singular third
person object pronoun 11A. The verbal token is made of a verb ktb, a masculine present
third person inﬂection y and a plural indicative inﬂection wn. This nature entails that the
type token ratio is much smaller than it is for a non-morphologically rich language like
English for example. This means that the same word does not repeat often enough for the
investigator to make valid observations. In order for any linguistic, especially lexical,
investigation to be reliable, one needs to perform some sort of morphological analysis
capable of reducing the word to its basic form. This has implications on Machine translation
as it means that no matter how big the training corpus is; the Arabic side will always suffer
from scarcity.

3 Pre-processing Arabic for SMT

With Arabic being morphologically complex and rich, lexical scarcity comes as a natural
result. In such cases it helps to reduce this morphological complexity in order to obtain
better alignments and decoding for Statistical Machine Translation (Habash et al., 2010).

Our goal at this stage is related to the pre-processing of Arabic as a source language, in
order to improve the quality of translation. First, in order to perform Arabic pre-processing,
we used a machine learning approach that performs word segmentation and POS tagging at
the segment level. We then use rules to derive the different pre-processing schemes

required for the machine translation experiments. Thus, instead of using MADA (Habash et
al., 2010), the well known morphological analyzer for Arabic, we choose our own
morphological analyzer that is memory-based learning for both word segmentation and
part of speech tagging (Emad and Kiibler, 2010).

The segmentation and POS tagging modules above give a rich representation with enough
information for almost any further required transformation. Given an input sentence like
(a), the system produces (b) as a segmented and annotated sentence, as described in the
following example:

(a) 04..-,‘=.-35‘ ,~.-é oa;.=Ls-4| oa 414:1! 3-.-»-U1‘ etkl--1|  ¢-I-.«bk-‘am dd:-.5)‘ 45:

Al/DET+$rEy/ADJ+yn/ NSUFF_MASC_PL_GEN

We set four different evaluations based on the variations on the output of the above
example, as follows:

Basic. The Basic experiment is the baseline of all the work we are doing. In this
experiment, the Arabic side undergoes minimal pre-processing in which we only separate
the punctuation and remove the occasional diacritization (the short vowels). Short vowels
do not normally occur in Arabic, but sometimes scattered ones are there mainly for
disambiguation purposes; however since their use is not standardized and subjective, their
removal usually leads to better agreement between the training and test sets.

Tokenized. In this context, tokenization means splitting the prefixes and suffixes that
have a syntactic value and that usually stand as independent words in other languages.
Examples of these include the possessive pronouns (-hm, -h, -y, -hA), conjunctions (w, f),
and prepositions (I-, k-, t-). We have also chosen to split the Arabic definite article A] due to
the perceived similarity in distribution between the Arabic and French deﬁnite articles.

The sentence above "wqd ArtbTt AlADTrAbAt btrHyl AlslTAt Alfrnsyp llEdyd mn
AlmhAjryn gyr Al$rEyyn "

is thus tokenized as "w/CON] qd/VERB_PART ArtbT/PV+t/PVSUFF_SUB]:3FS Al/DET
ADTrAb/NOUN+At/NSUFF_FEM_PL b/PREP trHyl/NOUN Al/DET

Al/DET $rEy/AD]+yn/ NSUFF_MASC_PL_GEN".

Where the conjunction w, the prepositions b and I, and the deﬁnite article A1 are no longer
preﬁxes, but separate tokens. The process also normalized the deﬁnite article from I to AI,
which is the more frequent form.

Morp Reduced. In the morphologically reduced experiment, we reduce the morphology of

Arabic to a level that makes it closer to that of the French language. An example of this is
the dual form, which does not occur in French and has thus been transformed to the plural.
The following table (Table 1) lists the most common examples of Arabic morphological
reduction.

Swapped. The swapped experiment tries to introduce some structural matching between
the source language (Arabic) and the target language (French). Two structural changes
have been attempted, as follows:

(a) While Arabic possessive pronouns follow the nouns, we have made them precede the
nouns in order to match the French. For example ktAb -y (book -my) has now become (-y
book) to match "mon livre" (in French).

(b) Arabic object pronouns, which follow the verb, have been made to precede it. >nA
>13/d 11 (I want it) is now >nA 11 >13/d with the purpose of matching the French structure "]e
1e Veux’.

4- Experiments on SMT

Our SMT system was trained on 3.5 million words of French and their parallel text in Arabic
(equivalent to 108 300 sentences) in addition to 9700 parallel sentences that were
extracted from the essentially comparable UN corpus of 2009. Thus, the total number of
sentences is 118 000 for the training corpora. The development corpus contains 20,000
words, namely 40,000 words with the reference. The evaluation corpus contains 15,000
words with 4 references.

The common practice of extracting bilingual phrases from the parallel data usually consists
of three steps: ﬁrst, words in bilingual sentence pairs are aligned using state-of-the-art
automatic word alignment tools, such as GIZA++ (Och and Ney, 2003), in both directions;
second, word alignment links are reﬁned using heuristics, such as Grow-Diagonal-Final
(GDF) method; third, bilingual phrases are extracted from the parallel data based on the
reﬁned word alignments with predeﬁned constraints (Och and Ney, 200 3).

The trigram language models are implemented using the SRILM toolkit (Stolcke, 2002).

Moses4 (Koehn et al., 2007), an open source toolkit for phrase-based SMT system, was used
as a decoder.

These steps of building a translation system are considered as a common practice in the
state-of-the-art of phrase-based SMT systems. Our research for improving the Arabic-
French SMT system was emphasized more on the pre-processing part of the SMT system.

We have measured the effect of the proposed pre-processing steps on data sparseness,
based on the percentage of unknown unigrams (OOVs) on a development set (dev set).
Table 2 summarizes the ﬁndings on the dev set. We give numbers in terms of tokens (the
total number of words) and types (the number of unique words in the text, i.e. no-
redundant words in the text).

Experiment % 00V (Types) % OOV (Tokens) BLEU score
Baseline 10.74 4.81 17.69
Tokenized 7.99 2.00 2 5.84
MorphReduced 7.87 1.98 2 6.33
Swapped 7.87 1.98 2 5.48

TABLE 2 — Effect of pre-processing on the development set

It can be noticed that the tokenization has a major effect on combatting data sparseness and
consequently improving the quality of translation as measured by the BLEU score.
Morphological normalization, which is a layer on top of tokenization, improves things even
further, and this is reﬂected in the difference between the baseline BLEU score and the
MorphReduced BLUE score which is 8.6 absolute points.

The swapped experiment leads the system output to deteriorate; which leads to a review of
the introduced rules for the structural matching between the source Arabic and the target
French languages, in the future.

Table 3 compares the results, in term of BLEU scores, of the 4 experimental settings in 3
evaluations schemes, as follows:

(a) Standard, which includes performing re-casing and removing white space before
punctuation,

(b) Nopunct; in which punctuation is stripped and evaluation is performed on the lexical
text only, and

(c) Nopunctcase in which, in addition to removing punctuation, all words are lower-cased.

We can see from Table 3 that the Baseline experiment produces the lowest results, and that
the tokenization scheme is a big leap with a 7.2 BLEU scores of improvement (25.9 vs.
33.1), which means that performing tokenization is a really a necessary step for translating

from Arabic, an that the morphological complexity of Arabic could be a hindrance to quality
automatic translation. While tokenization leads to considerable improvement,
morphological reduction fares even better with a 7.4 BLEU score higher than the baseline.
This could be due to the fact the morphological reduction reduces the number of unknown
words even further than tokenization alone. Swapping elements to match the target
language, which is built upon tokenization and morphological reduction, leads to a
deterioration of the results a little as it cancels out the effect of the morphological reduction
process. It is still an open question whether the positive effect of pre-processing will still
carry over with increasing the amount of training data and to what extent this will help.

Base Tokenized MorphReduced Swapped
Standard 25.9 33.1 33.3 33.1
Nopunct 23.8 31.5 31.7 31.4
Nopuncncase 2 5.8 34.1 34.1 3 4

5 Conclusion

We have presented an ongoing project on developing a competitive Arabic to French
machine translation, using the methods and data of the TRAD 2 102 evaluation campaign.

We have introduced pre-processing schemes for the source language (Arabic) and some
rules of language analysis related to the target language (French). Our method for POS
tagging and segmentation of Arabic texts showed a signiﬁcant improvement in terms of
BLEU score; however it does not assume the best results. The introduced morphological
rule that reduces the morphology of Arabic to a level that makes it closer to that of the
French language, showed the best results. We have introduces extra swapping rules, that
tries to introduce some structural matching between the source language (Arabic) and the
target language (French) ; however there was no improvement in terms of BLEU score. Our
future work is focused on the revision of these swapping rules and the introduction of more
rule for the recognition and transliteration of named entities; which makes our translation
system a hybrid rule-based and statistical SMT system. We will also investigate the
integration of more training data such as comparable corpora to make our SMT system
more competitive and reliable.
