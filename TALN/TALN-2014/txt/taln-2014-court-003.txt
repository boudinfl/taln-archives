Résumé.          Nous présentons un projet collaboratif en cours mené par l'université de Grenoble et l'université de
Xiamen, et visant àcréer des instances d'un nouveau type de système de traduction automatique statistique utilisant des
ressources lexico-sémantiques et discursives. Le but concret est de développer des systèmes de TAS chinois-français
pour des sites boursiers et économiques. Comme très peu de corpus et de dictionnaires bilingues chinois-français sont
disponibles sur Internet, l'anglais est utilisé comme "pivot" pour construire les équivalents chinois-français par
transitivité. Outre la description générale de ce projet, nous décrivons les progrès sur deux axes de recherche liés àce
projet. Pour cela, nous utilisons une méthode, proposée par XMU, d'induction de probabilité fondée sur la similarité
thématique, qui produit des tables de traduction C-F àpartir de tables de traduction C-E et E-F. Pour disposer de bons
corpus parallèles C-F, nous utilisons un système Web de post-édition collaborative qui peut déclencher l'amélioration
incrémentale du système de TA en utilisant des métriques d'évaluation de TA et en extrayant la "meilleure partie" de la
mémoire de traductions courante.

Abstract.         We present an on-going collaborative project pursued by Grenoble University and Xiamen University
and aiming at creating instances of a new kind of SMT system using semantics and discourse-related resources. The
concrete goal is to develop Chinese-French systems specialized to stock option and economic websites. Since very few
Chinese-French bilingual corpora and dictionaries are freely available on Internet, English is used as a “pivot” for
constructing the Chinese-French translation equivalents by transitivity. For this, we use a method, proposed by XMU, of
probability induction based on topic similarity, which produces C-F translation tables from C-E and E-F translation
tables. For getting good C-F parallel corpora, we use a web-based collaborative post-editing system that can trigger the
incremental improvement of the MT system by using MT evaluation metrics and extracting the "best part" of the current
translation memory.

1     Introduction
The desire and need for cross-cultural communication between China and Europe, both officially and non-
governmentally, are on the increase. Especially, France is an important strategic partner of China and has deep
relationships with China in many fields such as economy, science and technology, culture and education, etc. But the
language barrier between Chinese and French is impassable in most situations.

Concerning the economy, the cooperation between China and France grew rapidly in the past decades. France is now
China's fourth largest trade partner in the EU, behind Germany, the Netherlands and the UK. According to data from the
National Bureau of Statistics of China, bilateral trade between China and France increased from $13.4 billion in 2003 to
$51 billion in 2012. Two-way direct investments are also on the rise. With the continuous improvement of China's
investment environment, more and more French investors intend to invest in China. However, most portals of China,
such as the website of Shanghai Stock Exchange and the website of Shenzhen Stock Exchange, only provide a Chinese
version and an English version, but no French version. Moreover, Chinese investors are also more and more on the look
for opportunities in France and other francophone areas, notably in Africa.

Although French-Chinese bilingual applications are urgently needed in many situations, not much work has been done
yet on French-Chinese MT, and French-Chinese is still an under-resourced language pair as there are no large good

quality freely available bilingual lexico-semantic resources, and no sufficiently good MT systems. Most French-Chinese
MT systems, in particular GT (GoogleTranslate1) use English text as a pivot, which introduces more errors, often
degrading translation quality to uselessness, as illustrated below. Results may be useful for guessing the topic of a text,
but are otherwise bad or misleading, while investors need precise translations to decide whether to invest and where.
Here are two examples, both selected from the announcements of the Shanghai Stock Exchange. We show the result of
GT: output of GT-zh-en and then of en-fr (calling GT on zh-fr gives the same outputs) and en-PE-fr (post-edited en).

Ex1 (Source): 恢复交易后，如该证券交易中再次出现异常情况，本所可实施第二次停牌，停牌时间持续至今日

(GT-zh-en) After the resumption of trading in the securities trading as abnormal situation occurs again, this can be
implemented by the second suspension, suspension lasted until today the closing five minutes.
(GT-zh-en-PE) If the trading of this security appears to be abnormal again after resumption of its trading, we may
perform a second suspension upon it and this suspension will last until five minutes before today’s closing.

pouvons effectuer une deuxième suspension sur elle et cette suspension durera jusqu'à cinq minutes avant la clôture
d'aujourd'hui.

annual report of undisclosed corporate bonds should be April 30, 2014 disclosed in the annual report is completed work.
(GT-zh-en-PE) Fourth, the bonds which were listed before December 31, 2013 or listed in 2014, but have not yet
disclosed their annual reports of 2013, should complete the disclosure of their annual reports before April 30, 2014.

n'ont pas encore divulgué leurs rapports annuels de 2013, devrait compléter la divulgation de leurs rapports annuels
avant le 30 Avril 2014.

Examples above show that GT uses English as a pivot for the zh-fr direction. However, it is not the case for the fr-zh
direction: outputs are different. Google Translate is claimed to be one of the "state-of-the-art" MT system. The truth is
however that "state-of-the-art" for general MT systems means "very bad to useless": not knowing Chinese, one is at a
loss to guess the exact meaning. Also, even if an output looks good (due to the use of a good target language model), its
reliability may be very low, especially when negation appears or disappears at random (ex. 2 in French), or, as in these
examples, when essential words are badly translated ("If" → "après" [after] and not "si", "bond" → "lien" [link] and
not "obligation", "last" → "dernière" instead of "durer"), grammar is wrong leading to ununderstandability (ex. 2 in
French, at several points), dependencies have been modified ("its resumption of" should be "resumption of its"), and bad
handling of time in English leads to incorrect tenses in French (ex. 1 and 2). Actually, Example 2 is total gibberish in
French. No sense can be extracted from it. Example 1 has actually a negative adequacy2 in French, as it gives
counterfactual and misleading information (the suspension "has lasted until…" instead of "will last until…").

This illustrates the need of building direct MT systems between French and Chinese, specialized to the domains (stock
option markets, economy) and to the corresponding sublanguages. That will certainly considerably improve MT quality.
But, even if one augments the BLEU by 25% or more3, the problems above remain. In situations where exactness of
meaning is crucial and post-editing would require professionals working round the clock (because flash reports have a
life expectancy of only a few hours). To improve quality, semantic and discourse information should be used.

Section 2 will now give an overall description of this project. Then two aspects where progress has been made will be
described in Section 3 in more detail.

Adequacy is usually measured on a scale from 0 to 5, but should rather be similar to a kappa coefficient, ranging from -1 to +1.

In an experiment conducted at the EU, a Moses system was built on 50,000 sentences of the corpus of the Council. Compared to
the unspecialized system built on 20 M sentences (400 times more!), it showed an increase by 25% of the BLEU measure.

ON-GOING COOPERATIVE RESEARCH TOWARDS DEVELOPING ECONOMY-ORIENTED CHINESE-FRENCH SMT SYSTEMS
WITH A NEW SMT FRAMEWORK
2     Overview of the Project
As mentioned in Section 1, the overall goal of this project is to construct economy-oriented Chinese-French
computational linguistic resources, e.g. bilingual semantic resources, parallel corpora, and discourse structure annotation
banks, etc., then propose a new SMT model making use of semantic and discourse information, and finally build a web-
based collaborative post-editing platform. We distinguish three levels: data development, fundamental research, and tool
building. FIGURE 1 shows the overall organization of this project, in which three points should be noted.

FIGURE 1 : Overall picture of the project organization

Firstly, a pivot-based method is used for extracting the Chinese-French translation equivalents. We choose to use
English as a pivot, because it is much easier to gather large-scale Chinese-English and English-French parallel texts than
to directly collect Chinese-French ones. Moreover, pivot-based methods (Wu and Wang, 2007; Paul et al., 2009; Wu
and Wang, 2009) have been proven to be effective when building SMT systems for under-resourced language pairs.

Secondly, the translation model uses discourse-level information. Actually, recent research has shown that discourse-
level information is quite important for machine translation systems, especially those concerning Chinese (Gong et al.,
2011, 2012; Tu et al., 2013). As Chinese does not have grammatical markers of tense, the time at which an action takes
place usually has to be inferred from the context. Consider again example 1 in Section 1. The source sentence contains
three clauses, namely “恢复交易后，如该证券交易中再次出现异常情况 (If the trading of this security appears to be
abnormal again after resumption of its trading,)”, “本所可实施第二次停牌 (we may perform a second suspension upon
it)” and “停牌时间持续至今日收盘前五分钟 (and this suspension will last until five minutes before today’s closing.)”.
Because of the omission of the object in the second clause, we don’t know what the second suspension will be executed
for, and the unclearness of the tense in the third clause also contributed to the inadequacy of the translation. Suppose
now that we have the discourse graph shown in FIGURE 2 below. Both the omitted information and the tense information
could then be inferred. Therefore, we decide to conduct research on Chinese-French MT making use of discourse-level
information.
Condition

恢复交易后，如该证券交易中再次出                                                        Sequence

to be abnormal again after resumption         (we may perform a second      (and this suspension will last until five minutes
of its trading,)                    suspension upon it)                    before today’s closing.)

Thirdly, semantic knowledge is used when extracting the translation equivalents. We would do so because we found that
the previous pivot-based approaches, which do not take semantic knowledge into account, may produce incorrect
translation equivalents due to the lack of sufficient context. For example, suppose we have a phrase pair “银行 
bank” in the Chinese-English bilingual phrase table, and phrase pairs “bank  la banque” and “bank  la rive” in the
English-French bilingual phrase table. Then, using the transfer method (Paul et al., 2009; Wu and Wang, 2009), we get
two Chinese-French phrase pairs, i.e. “银行  la banque” and “银行  la rive”. However, the latter is obviously
wrong. We expect that, by incorporating semantic information, this problem could be overcome.

We distinguish seven subtasks in this project (see FIGURE 1), briefly described below.

1) Constructing Chinese-French bilingual lexico-semantic resources
This subtask aims at creating bilingual lexico-semantic data by enriching HowNet (Dong and Dong, 2006), a Chinese-
English conceptual database, with French data. In this subtask, economy-related bilingual terms will be integrated into
the semantic resource.

2) Constructing Chinese-French/Chinese-English/English-French parallel corpora
In order to carry out SMT research, parallel corpora are needed. Since very few Chinese and French bilingual data are
freely available on Internet, it is not easy to construct large-scale Chinese-French parallel corpora, especially economy-
oriented ones. Therefore, it is reasonable to build the resources of Chinese-French SMT systems using English as a pivot.
To this end, we are building Chinese-English and English-French bilingual corpora related to the domain of economy.
Then, to support learning structure transformation knowledge between Chinese and French, a medium-scale Chinese-
French parallel corpus will also be created.

3) Constructing Chinese discourse structure annotation bank
In order to incorporate discourse-level information in our Chinese-French SMT system, we first need a Chinese
discourse structure analysis module trained on Chinese discourse structure annotation banks. However, the Chinese
discourse structure annotation banks, currently under construction to support discourse-based Chinese-related MT
research, are not yet available now (Li et al., 2012). Hence, this subtask aims at constructing a Chinese discourse
structure annotation bank based on the Chinese part of the economy-oriented parallel corpora constructed in Subtask 2.
The course of constructing the annotation bank could be summarized as two steps. Firstly, sentences are partitioned into
sentence groups according to their topic similarities. Secondly, the relationships among the sentences in the same groups,
as well as the time information of the sentences or the time relationships between sentence pairs are humanly tagged.
The annotation result for example 1 in Section 1 may look like as follows:

(Discourse (Sentences (S1, 0-21), (S2, 22-32), (S3, 33-48)),
(Sentence-relationships (Condition S1, S2), (Sequence S2, S3)),
(Time-information Time(S1)=present, Time(S2)>Time(S1), Time(S3)=Time(S2)))

4) Chinese-French translation equivalents construction via English
Given the constructed Chinese-English and English-French parallel corpora, the objective of the subtask is to construct
Chinese-French translation equivalents. In the course of equivalents extraction, semantic information based on the
lexico-semantic resources constructed in Subtask 1 will be considered.

5) Chinese discourse structure analysis
The objective of this subtask is to research and propose a Chinese discourse structure analysis model based on the
Chinese discourse structure annotation bank constructed in Subtask 3.

6) Chinese-French SMT models using semantic and discourse information
The goal of this subtask is to propose a new Chinese-French SMT model using semantic and discourse information. In
the course of translation, the tense and semantic consistency across sentences will be considered, based on the discourse
graphs produced by the analysing module in Subtask 5 and the time model trained with the annotation bank in Subtask 3.

7) Web-based collaborative post-editing platform
The objective of this subtask is to build a collaborative web-based post-editing platform. This platform is built based on
iMAG/SECTra (Wang and Boitet, 2013), and incorporates the economy-oriented SMT system developed in Subtask 6.

ON-GOING COOPERATIVE RESEARCH TOWARDS DEVELOPING ECONOMY-ORIENTED CHINESE-FRENCH SMT SYSTEMS
WITH A NEW SMT FRAMEWORK
3     Some preliminary progresses
This project started in September 2013. Since then, we progressed on two fronts: data collection and pivot-base
construction of bilingual equivalents.

1) Data collection
From websites related to stock exchange, about 1000 bilingual web pages have been crawled and handled so far (Table
1 shows the statistics of this dataset).

Direction            # of pages            Size
zh-en                  761              39.4M
en-fr                  250              13.5M
TABLE 1: Statistics of the data collected so far

At the same time, with the participation of 2 Chinese students, we started the process of creating a Chinese-French
parallel corpus via post-editing, using an iMAG collaborative gateway, as in (Wang and Boitet, 2013).

2) Research on the pivot-based construction of bilingual equivalents
In previous pivot-based methods, such as (Wu and Wang, 2007), the translation probability induction may become
inaccurate if the semantic tendencies of the source-pivot (SP) corpus and the pivot-target (PT) corpus are different. To
overcome this problem, an effective method is to use context information to measure the semantic similarity of the rule
pairs. To solve this problem, we have proposed and validated a pivot probability induction method based on topic
similarity information. It consists of two steps.

Firstly, we use the topic model (Blei, 2003) to discover the latent topic structure for the pivot language document and
each synchronous pivot phrase rule is then attached with the topic distribution according to the document it comes from.
Formula 1 is used to assign topic distribution to a given rule.

 count ( I , D) P( z
D*
i   | dp)
P ( zi | r )                                                                (1)
  count ( I , D) P( z | d
zZ D*
p   )
where D is a bilingual document in the given bilingual corpus * . P( zi | d p ) represents the probability of the ith topic
of the pivot language document dp in D. In addition, the function count(I, D) denotes the frequency of the rule instance I
in D.

Secondly, the probability induction is executed by computing the topic similarity for the rule pairs instead of using
simple phrase translation probability multiplication between the SP and PT translation models. Formulas 2-3 are used:

 sim( P(Z | r
p
sp   ), P( Z | rpt ))
 (t | s )                                                                  (2)
 sim( P(Z | r
t        p
sp   ), P( Z | rpt ))
 sim( P(Z | r
p
tp   ), P( Z | rps ))
 (s | t )                                                                  (3)
 sim( P(Z | r
s        p
tp   ), P( Z | rps ))
where s , p , t and Z are the source phrase, pivot phrase, target phrase and topic distribution, respectively. sim(x, y)
is the similarity function, and is defined as the cosine (pseudo-distance) of vectors x and y (Formula 4).

x, y
sim( x, y )  cos( x, y )                                                   (4)

The experimental results showed that our method greatly outperforms the baseline. A paper related to this work was
published in the Journal of Computational Information Systems in 2013 (Huang et al., 2013).
4    Conclusion
This paper gives an introduction of a joint project between GETALP and the NLP lab of XMU on building economy-
oriented Chinese-French SMT systems, as well as its preliminary progress. We demonstrate the need of building direct
Chinese-French MT systems specialized field to that field and its sublanguages, and also explain why it seems to be
necessary to incorporate semantic and discourse-based information to obtain a quality (of raw MT) sufficient for the
needs of users, in a situation when usually there is no time for post-editing. This project is still in its initial stages and
many efforts are required in the future. However, specialized versions not yet using the new semantic- and discourse-
related features should be demonstrable at the time of the conference. We hope and believe that the future results of this
project will be useful in overcoming the language barrier of the communications between China and France in the
economy-related field.
