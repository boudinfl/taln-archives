Résumé.           Nous présentons dans cet article l’adaptation de l’outil de résumé automatique REZIME à la langue
française. REZIME est un outil de résumé automatique mono-document destiné au domaine médical et s’appuyant sur
des critères statistiques, syntaxiques et lexicaux pour extraire les phrases les plus pertinentes. Nous décrivons dans cet
article le système REZIME tel qu’il a été conçu et les différentes étapes de son adaptation à la langue française. Les
performances de l’outil adapté au français sont mesurées et comparées à celle de la version anglaise. Les résultats montrent
que l’adaptation au français ne dégrade pas les performances de REZIME, qui donne des résultats équivalents dans les
deux langues.
Abstract.          We describe the porting of the English language REZIME text summarizer to the French language.
REZIME is a single-document summarizer particularly focused on summarization of medical documents. Summaries are
created by extracting key sentences from the original document. The sentence selection employs machine learning tech-
niques, using statistical, syntactic and lexical features which are computed based on specialized language resources. The
REZIME system was initially developed for English documents. In this paper we present the summarizer architecture,
and describe the steps required to adapt it to the French language. The summarizer performance is evaluated for English
and French datasets. Results show that the adaptation to French results in system performance comparable to the initial
English system.

1      Introduction
The rapid growth of online text resources is producing information overload, where individuals cannot make use of all
the available information. This is particularly the case in specialised domains such as medicine and biomedicine, where
finding relevant information is critical. As stated by Afantenos et al. (2005), “the number of scientific journals in the fields
of health and biomedicine is unmanageably large, even for a single speciality”. This makes it very difficult for scientists
to follow the evolution of their domain. Laypersons seeking medical information from the internet are facing a similar
situation. Automatic summarization for the medical domain is a possible mechanism towards alleviating this problem.
In this paper we describe the French language version of the system REZIME, an automatic summarizer designed to
create efficient summaries of documents from the medical domain. It generates single-document summaries, built from
sentences containing key material extracted from documents. Sentence selection is based on machine learning techniques,
using statistical, syntactic and lexical features computed with specialized language resources. REZIME was initially
developed for English documents (Nguyen & Leveling, 2013). While its architecture is language-independent, porting it to
another language requires adaptation and/or translation of its linguistic resources (i.e. syntactic, lexical and terminological
resources). In this paper we present the different steps required to adapt it to another language and with a specific focus on
adapting the summarizer to the French language, and show its comparable effectiveness with the original English language
system.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows : After a brief description of the main studies in single-document
summarization in Section 2, we describe the REZIME architecture in Section 3. The main steps involved in its adaptation
to French are presented in Section 4. The evaluation of the French summarizer and the comparison of its performance to
the English version are shown in Section 5. We conclude with remarks on future work in Section 6.

Automatic summarization is defined as the process of creating “a text that is produced from one or more texts, that conveys
important information in the original text(s), and that is no longer than half of the original text(s) and usually significantly
less than that” (Radev et al., 2002). The two main approaches to text summarization are extractive summarization and
abstractive summarization. Extractive summarization consists in selecting parts of the original text that contain the most
important information which then form the summary. Extractive methods rely mostly on machine learning, using a set
of features to rank sentences (Mani & Bloedorn, 1998). Abstractive summarization aims at rephrasing the content of the
texts, generating sentences that do not necessarily appear in the original document (Barzilay & Mckeown, 2005).
While much summarization research has focused on the English language, the proliferation of online content in other
languages is creating a growing demand for multilingual summarization system. This topic has been explored in various
work, mostly concentrating single document summarisation of news corpora (Dalianis et al., 2004; Litvak et al., 2010).
Existing work in French summarization has mostly aimed at providing multilingual or cross-lingual summaries (Torres-
Moreno et al., 2001; Fernandez et al., 2008; Boudin & Torres-Moreno, 2009).
Summarization in specialised domains brings specific issues, with medicine raising unique challenges. As stated by Afan-
tenos et al. (2005) “uniqueness of medical documents is due to their volume, their heterogeneity, as well as due to the
fact that they are the most rewarding documents to analyse, especially those concerning human medical information due
to the expected social benefits”. While some systems for medical summarization already offer multilingual summaries,
for example using English documents to create French summaries (Lenci et al., 2002), our work focuses on the language
specific porting of an English language summarizer tuned to the medical domain.
3    A single document summarizer for medical text
REZIME is a single-document extractive summarizer that was initially designed for the English language, with specific
features developed for the medical domain (Nguyen & Leveling, 2013). The medical summaries generated by REZIME
are presented to patients and medical professionals. Therefore, the readability and clarity of the summaries is critical. In
the design of REZIME, we opted for an extractive approach since non-extractive ones may lead to incoherent sentences,
potentially giving inaccurate information to the user if it is incorrectly extracted from the original document.
F IGURE 1: REZIME Workflow

For summarization, each document is processed in a workflow consisting of four steps, illustrated in Figure 1. First, the
document is preprocessed to extract its structure (paragraphs, sentences, tokens). Each sentence is then represented by a
vector of features, that can either be statistical or linguistic.
Seven term checking features are used to detect the presence or absence of particular significant words or phrases in
sentences. It checks for the presence of pre-defined basic words that can help to create different summaries for a general
audience or for professionals, and searches for cue phrases such as “importantly” or “in summary” as they are good
indicators of whether a sentence should be included in a summary. It also counts the overlap of a sentence with the title
terms as a feature. A naive Named Entity recognition tool checks for the number of capitalized words (the first word of the
sentence is excluded). This naive approach is used since the summarizer is designed to work online and process summaries
on the fly, so speed and robustness are significant issues. Preposition detection is used since they often give context to
sentences. Finally, pronoun detection and counting of punctuation marks are used to discard sentences that contain too
many of these features, which can make them hard to interpret independently. Most of these features are commonly used
in summarization for newspaper articles (Lin, 1999).

S UMMARIZER ADAPTATION TO AN ALTERNATIVE LANGUAGE                                     [P-R.3]
Five non term checking features are used : a keyword cluster feature based on a method proposed by (Luhn, 1958) to
score sentences according to the number of significant words they contain ; the global bushy feature, which generates
inter-document links based on similarity of paragraphs (Salton et al., 1997) ; count of the number of terms in each sen-
tence, assuming that sentences which are too long or too short are less useful ; the position of a sentence in a paragraph,
since sentences occurring early in a paragraph usually give context for all the paragraph ; and finally, TF-ISF, which is a
sentence-level equivalent to TF-IDF.
Two features specific to the medical domain are also included : the affix presence feature, checking for terms containing
medically-related affixes (896 affixes) ; and the domain term feature, checking for terms appearing in a list of medical
terms (5,799 terms).
These features are then aggregated through a machine learning algorithm, in which the selection factors are combined in
a weighted linear summation. Since development of the best machine learning algorithm is still in progress, we set all
weights to 1 for this work. Finally, the selected sentences are post processed to provide a readable summary.
Some of these linguistic features rely on language-dependent resources. Their adaptation to the French language, is de-
scribed in the following section.
4     Porting REZIME to the French Language
In this section, we describe the resources used by REZIME and their adaptation to the French language. Summarizers
architectures and features are often language-independent, e.g. keyword or phrase matching, keyword clustering or the
global bushy algorithm. The major challenges of porting a summarizer to a new language relate mainly the availability
of the necessary linguistic resources in this language. Development of these resources can generally be achieved by
different methods : (i) using an existing resource in the target language ; (ii) manually translating an existing resource ;
(iii) automatically translating an existing resource ; or (iv) creating a new resource.
Option (iii) is in most cases not viable, especially for domain-specific resources in languages other than English. Option
(iv) is costly, both in terms of time and manual labour. Thus, for each resource, we opted for the first two methods.

4.1   Resources used in the REZIME System
Category         Resource name       Use
poss_sent_end       Indicates which tokens can end a sentence
Preprocessing    bad_sent_start      Indicates an impossible beginning for a sentence
resources        bad_sent_end        Indicates an impossible end for a sentence
abbreviations       List of common abbreviations
sections            Potential title of sections in a paper
cue_phrases         Keywords indicating that a sentence may be important
Feature          medical_dict        Affixes indicating a medical term (eg patho-, -trophy)
computation      medical_terms       List of medical terms
resources        SpacheWordList      List of most common words
stopwords           List of stopwords

TABLE 1: Resources for the Summarizer
The resources used by the summarizer can be divided into two categories : document processing resources and scoring
resources. Table 1 gives a list of the specific resources used and the category they belong to. The first category includes
keywords used for sentence boundary detection. These indicate how and where to split a text into paragraphs, a paragraph
into sentences, and a sentence into tokens. Most of these resources include generic vocabulary and/or punctuation marks.
The poss_sent_end resource contains punctuation marks that can appear at the end of a sentence (e.g.. ’.’, ’ ?’). The
abbreviation resource is composed of frequent acronyms and abbreviations (e.g.. ’Mr.’, ’Dr.’). Most of the resources from
this category are language independent (e.g. punctuation marks), at least among European languages.
The second category contains the resources used to represent sentences as vectors of features. These indicate sentence con-
tent that should be included in a summary. The cue_phrases resource contains a list of key phrases such as ’in conclusion’,
’the most important’. The SpacheWordList resource lists frequent and general terms that should be preferred in a summary
intended for non-specialists, e.g.. ’after’, ’again’. Two scoring resources are specialized for the medical domain. Affixes
for medical terms, which allow recognition of scientific terms, are created by using Greek and Latin elements (Andrews,
552

[P-R.3]
F IGURE 2: Strategies to port resources to the French language
1948). Nearly 900 of these affixes are gathered in our medicat_dict resource (e.g.. ’patho-’, ’-trophy’). The medical_terms
list consists of several thousands of medical terms, drug names and symptoms, collected from www.medterms.com.
These resources are mainly language dependent. Therefore they needed to be adapted to the French language. As described
in Figure 2, this requires a terminological and syntactical adaptation (translation), or sometimes involves including new
resources. We describe this process in the following sections.

4.2     Porting Resources to the French language
4.2.1    Preprocessing Resources
Preprocessing resources include elements enabling REZIME to split paragraphs into sentences and sentences into word to-
kens, shown in Table 1. These resources are not specialized and need simple translation from English. Some of these tools
did not need any modification since they contain only punctuation (poss_sent_end, bad_sent_start and bad_sent_end).
The only resource translated is the list of general abbreviations and acronyms (abbreviations), which were manually
translated by a native French speaker.

4.2.2    Adaptation of feature extraction resources
Feature extraction include elements used to represent sentences as feature vectors, in order to choose which ones should
be included in a summary, as shown in Figure 1. These language specific resources cannot be automatically translated
with a high enough accuracy for use in the REZIME system due to the presence of specialized vocabulary or specific
linguistic features, e.g. medical terms, cue phrases. As shown in Figure 2, resources can either be (i) kept as they are ; (ii)
translated ; or (iii) replaced by a French resource.

1. The list of medical affixes medical_dict did not have to be translated. These are Latin and Greek affixes (e.g. cephal-,
coron-, -phage), that are also widely used to create French medical terms.
2. We manually translated sections and cue_phrases. These resources were short lists and a manual translation was
the most cost-effective solution (e.g. significant).
3. Since similar resources were available in French, we replaced medical_terms, stopwords and SpacheWordList. The
medical_terms resource was created in a European project 1 . It contains 1,840 medical terms, available in 8 lan-
guages, including French and English. The stopwords list is a short list of 126 terms. The SpacheWordList is
composed of 1,750 words from the general language 2 .
5       Evaluation and Comparison of the English and the French Summarizers
The goal of this experiment is to assess the effectiveness the ported REZIME summarizer, by investigating its performance
relative to the original English summarizer. While an evaluation on a parallel test collection in two languages would have
been ideal, we did not have access to such a collection. We test our system on two independent collections, both from
the medical domain, but on two different specialities (the English one is generic, the French one deals with endoscopy).

F IGURE 3: ROUGE scores for the English and the French summaries with REZIME

Our assumption is that the topical focus will not affect the results significantly, since the resources come from the same
domain. In this section, we describe the two corpora used for our experiments and the encouraging results we obtained.
5.1   Evaluation Test Collections
To evaluate the similarity of the two systems, we used comparable corpora from the medical domain. We created a
corpus for the French language from scientific articles on a medical speciality journal : Acta Endoscopica. The English
corpus was composed of articles from BioMed Central (BMC) 3 . We assume a manually written abstract is a good quality
summary of the scientific articles, and use these as a gold standard reference for automatic summarization to evaluate our
system (da Cunha & Wanner, 2005).
The automatically created summaries are limited to a length of about 230 words which is comparable in length to the
manual abstract provided with the documents. Our test sets consists of 100 documents in each language. Table 2 provides
some statistics on the corpora.
5.2   Results
We measure the quality of the automatically created summaries using the ROUGE measure (Lin, 2004). We use ROUGE-2
and ROUGE-3 with and without considering stopwords, as they are the most widely used ROUGE scores. We are inter-
ested in changes that porting to French causes to the behaviour of the REZIME system. Figure 3 shows the experimental
results.
We observe that the ROUGE-3 scores are almost identical for the two systems. The ROUGE-2 score drops by one point at
most for the French system, we believe this is mostly due to the differences between corpora, the French corpora belonging
to a more specific medical area, with terms that do not appear in our list of medical terms. ROUGE-3 gives lower results
than ROUGE-2, as would be expected, since it is based on 3-grams instead of bigrams.
This experiment shows that porting the summarizer to another language leads to similar summarization performance.
The lack of parallel data and the consequent use of varied evaluation collections could affect the results, but additional
experiments would be required to investigate this potential effect.

6    Conclusion and Future Work
In this paper, we described methods to adapt an extractive summarizer to another language. We presented results showing
that single document summarization systems based on extraction can be successfully ported to an alternative language. Our
adaptation technique is based on selecting and generating adequate resources by translation, which is an adequate approach
even when the system deals with a specific context like the medical domain. We also created a new summarization
evaluation collection, consisting of French documents from the medical domain.
As part of future work, we plan to investigate whether the technique which has been shown to be successful for French is
also applicable to other pairs of languages, and to other domains.
