Abstract
The aim of this paper is to compare the behaviour of Polish and Romance pronominal clitics
in tense auxiliary constructions and to account for Polish facts. First, we present the system of
Polish auxiliaries, briefly comparing it to Romance. Then, we discuss clitic climbing (CC), the
phenomenon well-known in Romance. We contrast Polish CC with CC in Italian and French.
Finally, we present a formal analysis of Polish CC. Our analysis is coached within the frame-
work of HPSG (Head-driven Phrase Structure Grammar, (Pollard & Sag, 1987; Pollard & Sag,
1994)), which has been also used to account for CC in Romance. We follow (Borsley, 1999) in
treating Polish auxiliaries as syntactic items. However, we do not find his argumentation strong
enough to motivate the adaptation of the analysis proposed for French auxiliaries, (Abeillé &
Godard, 1994), to Polish. We account for CC in Polish assuming that clitics can be realised
independently of non-clitic arguments. Such an approach correctly explains optionality of CC
in Polish without specifying what the constituent structure of auxiliary constructions looks like.
1. Tense Auxiliaries
As argued in (Borsley & Rivero, 1994), past tense, (1a), and conditional verbs, (1b), are
formed with an auxiliary as well:

(1)        a.     Ty widział -és    ten film.                                          ‘You saw this film.’
you seen   AUX.2sg this film
b.     Ty widział -býs        ten film.                             ‘You would see this film.’
you seen   AUX-COND.2sg this book

Although (e)́s and býs in (1) look like verbal inflection, they can be detached from the verb and
occur on (almost) any other preceding word, 1 (2) (see (Booij & Rubach, 1987) or (Spencer,
1991, ch.9) for more examples).
1
Transitive prepositions and the verbal negative marker nie ‘not’ are the exceptions discussed in (Borsley &
Rivero, 1994).

(2)       a.           Ty -́s      widział ten film.                           ‘You saw this film.’
you AUX.2sg seen    this film
b.           Ty býs          widział ten film.                ‘You would see this film.’
you AUX-COND.2sg seen    this film

The behaviour of‘floating inflections’ illustrated in (1) and (2), has been often discussed in
the literature, e.g., (Mikós & Moravcsik, 1986), (Booij & Rubach, 1987), (Rappaport, 1988),
(Spencer, 1991), (Borsley & Rivero, 1994), (Borsley, 1999). We follow here (Borsley & Rivero,
1994) and (Borsley, 1999) and treat boldfaced forms in (1) and (2) as consisting of a weak
auxiliary (a clitic) and a participle. We adopt the analysis of (Borsley, 1999) of verb forms
in (1) and treat them as morphological compounds (complex verbs). We also follow (Borsley,
1999) and assume that weak auxiliaries are syntactic items. However, our analysis of auxiliary
constructions, such as in (2), will be different.
(Borsley, 1999) represents weak auxiliaries as (subject-raising) syntactic verbs which subcat-
egorize for a participle, similarly to the future auxiliary. He argues, however, that the future and
weak auxiliaries should have different complementations. The former takes a VP complement
(a traditional hierarchical structure results, (3a)) while the latter form a complex (syntactic)
predicate with the participle. Hence, weak auxiliaries subcategorize for a verbal complement (a
participle) as well as its complements, which results in a flat syntactic structure, (3b) (similarly
to French and Italian tense auxiliary constructions, cf. (Abeillé & Godard, 1994) and (Monach-
esi, 1997a), respectively).

Such an analysis, however, makes incorrect predictions with respect to CC.
2. Clitic Climbing
CC is a cross-linguistical phenomenon associated with certain verbal environments. In cer-
tain verbal contexts, a pronominal clitic can be realised on a verb different from that it seman-
tically belongs to, e.g., (4).

(4)       Bede ,   ,
go ogladał jutro.
‘I’ll be watching it tomorrow.’
will.be.1sg himcl seen tomorrow

In (4), the clitic go ‘him’ originates as an argument of the verb ogladał but is realised on the

auxiliary rather than locally.
In Polish, unlike, e.g., in Romance, CC to tense auxiliaries is optional. As illustrated in (5),
the argument clitic need not be realised on the future auxiliary and can remain ‘downstairs’.

(5)       Bede ,   ,
ogladał go jutro.
‘I’ll be watching it tomorrow.’
will.be.1sg watched itcl tomorrow

The behaviour of Polish pronominal clitics with weak auxiliaries is analogous: clitics are fac-
ultatively realised on the auxiliary, cf. (6).

(6)       a.    Czesto -́s
go widywał przedtem.                   ‘You saw it/him often before.’
often AUX.2sg itcl seen  before
b.    Czesto -́s widywał go przedtem.
(7)       a.    Chetnie bym
go obejrzał jutro.
willingly AUX-COND.1sg itcl seen         tomorrow
‘I would like to see it tomorrow.’
b.    Chetnie bym obejrzał go jutro.
Also if there are several clitics, they occur on the auxiliary only optionally, cf. (8). It seems,
however, that in auxiliary constructions all clitics must be realised on the same verb, cf. (8c–d).
Properties of CC in the conditional and future auxiliary constructions are analogous.

(8)       a.    Bardzo -́s       przestraszył sie go wczoraj.

very AUX.2sg feared           selfcl himcl yesterday
‘He frightened you very much yesterday.’
b.    Bardzo -́s sie go przestraszył wczoraj.
c. ?? Bardzo -́s sie przestraszył go wczoraj.
d. * Bardzo -́s go przestraszył sie wczoraj.
Polish pronominal clitics are syntactic items. They do not form a prosodic word with the
host, (Rappaport, 1988), can be elided, do not have a fixed position in a sentence and are promis-
cuous, (Spencer, 1991, ch.9). Therefore, if we adopt Borsley’s (1999) analysis of auxiliaries,
CC in the future tense constructions, (3a), shouldn’t be possible (complements are not raised to
the auxiliary). According to (3b), all clitics should occur on weak auxiliaries rather than on the
participle. As (4)–(8) show, these expectations are not born out: all types of auxiliaries trigger
CC only optionally.
The main argument put forward in(Borsley, 1999) for two structures given in (3), is the
contrast in (9).

(9)       a. * Widział ksiaż ke -́s/
,       ,
býs.                         ‘You saw/would see the book.’
seen    book AUX.2sg COND-AUX.2sg
b.     Widział ksiaż ke bedziesz.
,       ,   ,
‘You will see the book.’
seen    book will.be.2sg

This contrast apparently shows that in (9a), unlike in (9b), there is no constituent to be preposed.
Since Polish is a ‘free’ word order language and various permutations are possible, it is not clear
whether the participle does form a constituent with its complement in (9b). Other traditional
constituency tests, e.g., coordination or pronominalization, do not distinguish the complemen-
tation of weak and future auxiliaries. Moreover, contrasts similar to (9) are also observed in the
behaviour of pronominal clitics:

(10)         Zaprosimy      jutro    jego/ *go na kolacje.              ,
‘We will invite him for dinner
will-invite-we tomorrow him himcl on dinner
tomorrow.’

The contrast in (10) cannot be explained analogously to (9). The pronominal clitic is not a
head while the sequence zaprosimy jutro ‘we will invite tomorrow’ does not form a constituent.
Instead, we attribute contrasts in (9) and (10) to a restriction on linear positions of Polish clitics.
We exclude the ungrammaticality of (9a) by a linear precedence constraint.

3. HPSG Analysis
We follow (Sag, 1997), Bouma et al. (1997), (Miller & Sag, 1997) and Abeillé et al. (1998)
and split the synsem type into canonical and non-canonical subtypes. As said above, we treat
weak auxiliaries (following (Borsley, 1999)) and pronominal clitics as syntactic items. Since
Polish clitics correspond to signs, we represent them via a clitic type, a subtype of canonical.
We further split clitic into pron-cl and aux-cl for pronominal and auxiliary clitics, respectively,
cf. (11).2
HH
(11)                                  synsem
H
HH
non-canonical canonical

HHH
non-clitic clitic

pron-cl
H
aux-cl

We represent Polish pronominal clitics on the COMPS list, i.e., the list of complements which are
combined with the head in the syntax. Apart from the reflexive clitic, which is always introduced
lexically, see (Kuṕsć , 1999), personal clitics and other NPs can be used interchangeably. Since
the value of COMPS is specified as a list of synsems, both clitics and non-clitic elements can
occur here. These are syntactic principles and ID schemata which remove pronominal clitics
from COMPS , rather than lexical mechanisms as in the analyses of Romance in (Monachesi,
1995; Monachesi, 1997b; Monachesi, 1997a), (Miller & Sag, 1997), Abeillé et al. (1998).
In order to account for CC, we assume that realisation of (syntactic) pronominal clitics can
be independent of realisation of non-clitics.3 Since there are no strong arguments in favour of
two distinct complementations in (3), we assume that all auxiliary constructions have the same
type of syntactic structure. We assume the following subcategorization frame for all auxiliaries:
2                                           3
(12)         HEAD   verb[ AUX +]

6             HEAD verb[VFORM part]         7

Both subtypes of clitic can be further split. For example, pron-cl can be divided into ana-cl and p-cl in order
to distinguish the reflexive clitic (ana-cl) from personal clitics, cf. (Kuṕsć , 1999). Analogously, past-aux and
cond-aux can be distinguished, cf. (Borsley, 1999). Since these subtypes are inessential here, we omit them for
clarity.
3
(Kuṕsć , 1999) makes a similar assumption in order to account for ‘haplology’ of the Polish (syntactic) reflexive
clitic sie, ‘self’.

Unlike in (Borsley, 1999), the value of the participle’s COMPS list, i.e., 2 , is underspecified.
This allows us to encode the fact that pronominal clitics can raise independently of non-clitic
complements. Assuming that auxiliary constructions have a hierarchical structure, i.e., an aux-
iliary subcategorizes for a VP, we replace the Immediate Dominance Schema of (Pollard & Sag,
1994) which combines a lexical head and complements with (13):
2

4 DTRS 4 HEAD- DTR word        5           5
COMP - DTRS     list(sign)

This constraint licenses phrases which may have a certain number of clitics unrealised. Such a
phrase is necessary to account of CC in a hierarchical structure, i.e., if an auxiliary combines
with a VP which has unrealised clitics, e.g., (4). Observe that list(pron-cl) is any list of pron-cl
elements. In particular, this list can be empty if all pronominal clitics (if there are any) are
realised, i.e., [ COMPS hi] as in the traditional schema of (Pollard & Sag, 1994). Hence, local
realisation of clitics in a hierarchical structure is also accounted for, e.g., (5). The constraint on
clauses will ensure saturation of all (clitic and non-clitic) complements within a clause:
h                                   i
(14)       clause ! SYNSEMjLOC jCAT jVALjCOMPS hi

As shown in (8), in auxiliary constructions all clitics must be realised on the same verb (an
auxiliary or a participle). We obtain this by the following lexical constraint:4
2                                            3

arg                         "             #                            arg

4 ARG pron-cl5 )
REAL      +                     ARGpron-cl

Finally, the following LP constraint excludes incorrect positions of weak auxiliaries such as
(9a).

4 HEAD verb 5 5       SS 2
HEAD   verb   VFORM   part

This constraint differs from that proposed in (Borsley, 1999). Instead of requiring a lexical
participle verb to be ordered with respect to any auxiliary, (16) refers only to weak auxiliaries
(aux-cl) and does not require the participle to be lexical. Note that (16) is formulated in terms of
dom objs (objects used to encode linear order in HPSG, cf. (Kathol, 1995)) and does not refer
to syntactic constituents directly. Due to such a representation of linear order, the syntactic
structure of auxiliary constructions is in principle inessential for (16).
4
We use arg rather than synsems here in order to distinguish realised ([ REAL +]) from unrealised ([ REAL?])
arguments, cf. (Przepíorkowski, 1998). The relation ‘ ’ is used to ‘shuffle’ elements of several lists preserving
order between members of original lists, as in shuffling a deck of cards, cf. (Reape, 1992). The ‘member’ relation
is a usual list membership relation.
